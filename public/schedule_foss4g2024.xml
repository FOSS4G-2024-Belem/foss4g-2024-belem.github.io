                <abstract>Effective monitoring of forest carbon is essential for accurately estimating carbon emissions, detecting forest degradation, and enhancing forest management practices. This is particularly critical in biodiversity hotspots like the Amazon Rainforest, which not only sequesters vast amounts of terrestrial carbon but is also under constant threat from illegal deforestation and degradation.
In 2023, Planet launched Forest Carbon Diligence, a product that delivers annual global maps of canopy height, cover, and aboveground carbon (AGC) at a spatial resolution of 30 meters, covering the years 2014 to 2023. This initiative has already supported various applications, including a study published by Monitoring by the Andean Amazon Project (MAAP), revealing that the Amazon Rainforest stores approximately 56.8 billion metric tons of aboveground carbon (AP News, 2024; Mongabay, 2024).
Building on this foundation, in September 2024, Planet introduced Forest Carbon Monitoring, a groundbreaking product that offers a global map of canopy height, cover, and AGC with a remarkable spatial resolution of 3 meters, updated quarterly. This enhanced capability allows for more detailed analysis of forest dynamics, providing timely insights into forest conditions and changes.
This talk will address two primary objectives:
Technical Insights: I will cover the development and validation of Forest Carbon Monitoring, highlighting its intercomparison with other existing products. Beyond providing quarterly snapshots, this system enables near-real-time monitoring of landscape changes, comparable to alert systems like RAdar for Detecting Deforestation (RADD) and Global Forest Change datasets. I will demonstrate how this tool is instrumental in identifying deforestation activities and directing conservation efforts to the most vulnerable areas of the Brazilian Amazon.
Community Engagement and Collaboration: In this segment, I will illustrate Planet's commitment to fostering community engagement and collaboration through several key initiatives:
1.	Open-Source Contributions: Planet actively collaborates with the Free Open Source Software for Geospatial (FOSS) community by using and contributing to open repositories such as pystac, GDAL, xarray, and Dask. This open-source approach encourages innovation, enhances tool accessibility, and supports diverse applications for the geospatial community.
2.	Partnerships for Impact: Our collaboration with Santiago &amp; Cintra Consultoria (SCCON) in Brazil exemplifies the power of partnership. In the past year, Planet data assisted Brazilian Federal police agents in executing over 3,000 interventions to combat illegal activities, resulting in a remarkable 50% reduction in deforestation rates. This partnership not only strengthens law enforcement efforts but also builds local capacity for sustainable forest management.
3.	Inclusive Access Programs: Planet offers initiatives like the NICFI and Education and Research programs, which provide users with free access to Planet data. By democratizing access to critical information, we empower researchers, conservationists, and local communities to utilize our data for informed decision-making and collaborative conservation efforts.
Through this presentation, I hope to engage the audience in a dialogue about the crucial intersection of technology, conservation, and community involvement, underscoring the vital role of precise forest carbon monitoring in addressing global environmental challenges.</abstract>

                <abstract>This presentation introduces an innovative project designed to enhance the precision of urban nuclei mapping using advanced artificial intelligence techniques. The focus is on improving the urban nuclei layer managed by the Institut Cartogràfic i Geològic de Catalunya (ICGC) through the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The project involves training a CNN model on a curated collection of images featuring diverse urban nuclei. This training process enables the model to learn intricate patterns and characteristics unique to urban areas. Once the model is adequately trained, it can autonomously detect and categorize urban nuclei in new images with high accuracy.</abstract>

                <abstract>Every geospatial project begins with a quest for answers. Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing how we can directly understand user needs through techniques like natural language to data structure conversion. Over the couple years, we have been exploring how AI could be used for working with geospatial data. What started as figuring out how to use natural language to make STAC queries to find public data has led to much more, including natural language geocoding to contextual image searching of public data such as NAIP and Sentinel-2.

In this talk we will explore how AI can be used to help automate some of geospatial’s most tedious tasks using open data, and how open vision models can be combined to create powerful tools for search &amp; discovery of earth imagery.

This talk will include an overview of AI for use in geospatial analysis, with a focus on using open data and open models. We will show some live demos to create accurate AOIs with natural language, as well as for advanced searching of landscape features in public datasets. Additionally we will give an overview of techniques like Retrieval Augmented Generation and LLM Agents and the potential for how these may be used to transform geospatial data science.</abstract>

                <abstract>In the planning and expansion of water supply schemes, there needs to be detailed mapping and documentation of existing pipeline network and their assets. However this is usually not the case, especially where the construction of these pipelines predates advances in mapping, geoinformation and database where they in prior existed as drawing and engineering plans. In order to migrate to a fully documented inventory, digitalisation and management of a water supply network database to estimate demand and supplies to plan expansion and population growth, there needs to be an inventory of existing scheme. Historically, mapping has been done with expensive mapping and survey equipment that can pose a challenge for small organisation’s budget, making it difficult to have a complete mapping inventory of its network.
This article presents a geographical information system–based free and opensource software architecture for the mapping and inventory of urban water supply network. This architecture is especially useful where budget is tight and decision relating to meeting the water and sanitation-related Sustainable Development goals needs to be made. The architecture consists of data management, data collection, data analysis and project host environment tools and software.
PostGresSQL with PostGIS was used for design and management of water supply network GIS database, basing the creation and design of features and attributes on prior knowledge of what exists on water supply networks. Features created are transmission and distribution pipelines, hydrants, valves, chambers, junctions, leaks, encroachments, pumps, pump stations, reservoirs, bulk flowmeter, treatment stations with attributes across that include diameter, pipeline material, operational status, condition, encroachment, photo; sizes, capacity, models, manufacturer etc. The PostGIS database was connected to a QGIS project environment where custom forms to were designed to capture attributes created in PostGIS. The QGIS project was linked to an android based mobile app data collection software called Qfield, hosting custom forms designed in QGIS to capture the content of the water supply features, location and attributes. Using the form on Qfield, the water supply network is mapped and attributes captured and once data capture has been carried out using Qfield software, data from field capture is synchronised to QGIS project and following edits to the data captured, it is updated to the PostGresSQL PostGIS database. QGIS software acting as the project host environment also functions as the software for mapping, visualising and analysis of data hosted and managed
The architecture presented is an opportunity for any organisation seeking a free and open source GIS option in capturing and documenting and managing their water supply network data. As one of the weaknesses, is that data captured using Qfield has the inherent horizontal and vertical accuracy acquired from android devices which is less accuracy than that from a survey equipment. However, Qfield has the option of connecting to GNSS equipment by blue tooth, inheriting the sub cm horizontal and vertical accuracy it offers and thus improving locational and elevation information and still offering a higher accuracy free open source option.</abstract>

                <abstract>GeoPortal PMPV is a WebGIS platform developed by the Department of Geoprocessing – GEO of the Municipal Secretariat of Planning, Budget and Management – ​​SEMPOG of the City of Porto Velho, which aims to access, consult, analyze and disseminate geographic data from the Municipality of Porto Velho, based on the Municipal Urban and Territorial Information System – SMIUT of Article 45, of Complementary Law Nº 838, of February 4, 2021, which addresses the Participatory Master Plan of Porto Velho.
	“Article 45 – The Municipal System of Urban and Territorial Information will be established using a georeferenced digital cartographic base of the Municipality, progressively integrating the various databases of the City Hall to create the Municipal Multifunctional Technical Registry, which will be used for planning and management by all sectors of the Administration and as a tool for transparency of municipal information.” (LEI COMPLEMENTAR Nº 838, 2021, p. 20).
The GeoPortal holds relevance and significance grounded in socioeconomic, technical, and professional aspects. It contributes to the dissemination of municipal information for various uses, ranging from the general public to academics and professionals in different fields. This platform offers several functionalities, including: geoservices such as Web Map Service – WMS and Web Feature Service – WFS, and access to 53 geospatial layers accompanied by their respective metadata. Additionally, the GeoPortal offers compendium services that cover the geographic boundaries, historical context, and laws regarding the creation and modification of the 13 districts and the main administrative area that make up the municipality of Porto Velho, as well as the 72 neighborhoods within the municipal seat.
In this way, the PMPV GeoPortal provides easy access to georeferenced information for the municipality of Porto Velho, covering data on drainage, neighborhoods, schools, health units, among others. This platform promotes data transparency for the population, encouraging citizen participation in the municipality's planning and management projects. This not only increases the transparency of government actions, but also strengthens the relationship between public administration and citizens, creating a collaborative environment for building a more inclusive and sustainable city.

                <abstract>At  the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT), we are working on a group of free and open source tools for community creation of maps. Following a process that involves aerial imagery gathering with UAVs, remote volunteer mapping, community in-the-field data collection, AI assisted remote sensing, and finally, downloading and using the map in disasters and humanitarian work. This is an end-to-end (E2E) solution that benefits everyone, from a small community to a big organization. We want to tell the story about how we’re creating and using these tools and what could be the future of humanitarian and disaster mapping from an open tech and data perspective. 

We hope that you leave this talk inspired and excited about becoming part of the end to end mapping journey!</abstract>

                <title>Using Open-Access Spatial Data for Enhanced Sanitation Planning</title>
                <subtitle />
                <type>Talk</type>

                <abstract>This talk aims to explore the potential of using open-access spatial data to support the early stages of sanitation system planning. QGIS, an open-source Geographic Information System (GIS) software, will be used to process and analyze the data.

The lack of reliable and up-to-date data in developing countries represents a significant barrier to the effective planning of sanitation projects. Despite the growth in the availability of new open-access data, its application in sanitation projects and planning is still limited. To fill this gap, the lecture aims to identify, catalog, and use essential primary spatial datasets - such as population data, building footprints, and street registers - available globally in order to support sanitation planning. By adopting a data-driven approach, it will be possible to select the most appropriate sanitation system according to the local context. These systems include both on-site solutions and centralized systems with sewage collection networks. 

The criteria for selecting datasets are oriented towards ensuring compatibility with Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards and adherence to FAIR principles. By implementing this approach in a selected case study area, the talk aims to demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of integrating open-access data related to demographics and existing infrastructure in sanitation planning.

The ultimate goal is to highlight the importance of quality open data, which is essential for filling an existing gap in sanitation planning. This promotes the democratization of access to quality information and the use of free GIS tools, allowing the inclusion of local professionals in sanitation projects in developing countries, and consequently improving the results of these projects.</abstract>

                <abstract>This talk presents a case study of Inteligeo, an adaptation of GeoNode for Brazilian government agencies. We'll share our journey in taming a 170TB raster dataset and other adventures in customizing open-source geospatial tools. We outline the experience of four agencies: The National Water Agency (ANA), the Center for the Surveillance of the Amazon (CENSIPAM), the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBIO), and the Federal Police (PF).

The project, which began in 2009 using proprietary software, transitioned to open-source in 2017. To address limitations and support multiple agencies, we ported Inteligeo version 4 functionality to GeoNode, creating Inteligeo 5 in 2022. Each agency has a unique perspective: PF was involved from the start, CENSIPAM deployed for internal use, ANA for external use, and ICMBIO is integrating it into their processes.

Why customize at all? Why not just use the software as it is? Why not develop it from scratch? There are several reasons why one should (and shouldn't) customize, and then there are several ways how to do it right once you commit to it. We share our experiences: the good and the bad, and the lessons learned, when customizing GeoNode for the Brazilian government.

Why customize?
- Get shiny new functionality!
- Jump-start development
- Optimize processes with tailored deployments and workflows
- Integrate with existing systems and infrastructure (authentication, 170TB raster storage, Brasil Mais imagery)
- Comply with internal and government standards

Challenges:
- Non-standard deployment
- Training and documentation
- Balancing customization with community support
- Syncing with upstream changes
- Managing a huge codebase with extra stuff that you don't need

How to do it right (aspirational):
- Seek sponsorships (SGD/MGI, JICA, FINEP, INTERPOL)
- Selfless and selfish reasons to contribute back to the community
- Have a clear strategy for upstream syncing
- Keep it simple. Minimize customization to essential features
- Design independent, standalone components
- Engage upstream developers when possible

Our experience is particularly relevant to the Amazon region, as the tool directly supports the Federal Police surveillance and conservation efforts in the area and is being integrated by the agencies of the other speakers.

                <abstract>The State of California has a recurring issue of devastating wildfires that spread out of control, causing significant damage to the well-being of its citizens, environment, and economy.

Due to this recurring issue, the State of California and the USDA—United States Forest Service committed to treating one million acres of land (roughly 400,000 hectares) to reduce the occurrence and severity of these wildfires. Planscape was created to prioritize and guide this one million-acre effort.

Planscape is a freely available tool built to help landscape planners, public agents and the general public prioritize and learn about landscape interventions that minimize fire risk and cost while maximizing ecological benefits. 

Planscape utilizes zonal statistics data gathered from over 200 raster layers, applying Linear Programming techniques to determine the best locations for planners to intervene in the landscape by performing treatments such as mastication, prescribed burns, etc.

This hands-on session will discuss several options for obtaining Zonal Statistics for Planscape. In this benchmark, we can compare a diverse range of technologies and techniques utilized to reduce the necessary time to obtain zonal statistics for roughly 24 million regular polygons covering the state of California and, over 200 million zonal statistics records.

This talk benchmarks the following methods: PostGIS + PostgreSQL, Python RasterIO, rasterstats, custom code.</abstract>

                <abstract>Spatial Temporal Asset Catalogs (or better known as STAC) is a recently developed specification that provides a common language to describe geospatial information so it can more easily be indexed and discovered. STAC metadata can be used to quickly identify all available data for a given product, location or time period. This information can then be used to efficiently stream data from the cloud into web based services, like Soar, without having to host content locally. Cloud-Optimized Geospatial File formats such as cloud optimized geospatial TIFF’s (COG) allow quick and efficient consumption of raster files via http. The enhanced metadata has characteristics that allow for parallelized and partial reading of the file. Although STAC has an established standard, content vendors implement it in different ways.

We will use five open data examples in this presentation - the Toitū Te Whenua Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) Imagery datasets, Maxar Open Data Program, Umbra Open Data Program, Chief Directorate: National Geo-spatial Information (CDNGI) and the United States Geological Service (USGS) Historical Topographic Map Collection (HTMC) - to illustrate how cloud optimized web services and Cloud-Optimized Geospatial File formats can be utilized quickly and easily within a web services environment.</abstract>

                <abstract>Soar is an online atlas of maps, free and open. Our mission is to make maps publicly accessible.  
Our goal is to bring together every map, satellite, and drone image that has ever existed, or will ever exist, in one place. 
Therefore, it is aimed at both lay people who appreciate maps and professionals.
Soar is a collaborative platform: maps come from both organizations and individuals.
For greater interactivity, we have created map editing tools and a QGIS-Soar integration plugin.
We propose to show in this short talk how to access and build upon the multitude of open data maps on Soar catalog using Soar-QGIS Plugin.</abstract>

                <title>GeoHealthCheck - QoS Monitor for Geospatial Web Services</title>

                <type>Talk</type>

                <abstract>Keeping (OGC) Geospatial Web Services up-and-running is best accommodated by continuous monitoring: not only downtime needs to be guarded, 
but also whether the services are functioning correctly and do not suffer from performance and/or other Quality of Service (QoS) issues.
GeoHealthCheck (GHC) is an Open Source Python application for monitoring uptime and availability of OGC Web Services.
In this talk we will explain GHC basics, how it works, how you can use and even extend GHC (plugins).

There is an abundance of standard (HTTP) monitoring tools that may guard for general status and uptime of web services. 
But OGC web services often have their own error, "Exception", reporting not caught by generic HTTP uptime
checkers. For example, an OGC Web Mapping Service (WMS) may provide an Exception as a valid XML response or
in a error message written "in-image", or an error may render a blank image. 
A generic uptime checker may assume the service is functioning as from those requests and an HTTP status "200" is returned.

Other OGC services may have specific QoS issues not directly obvious. A successful and valid "OWS GetCapabilities" response may not 
guarantee that individual services are functioning correctly. For example an OGC Web Feature Service (WFS) based on a dynamic database may 
return zero Features on a GetFeature response caused by issues in an underlying database. Even standard HTTP checkers supporting "keywords" 
may not detect all failure cases. Many OGC services will have multiple "layers" or feature types, 
how to check them all?

What is needed is a form of semantic checking and reporting specific to OGC services!

GeoHealthCheck (GHC) is an Open Source (MIT) web-based framework through which OGC-based web services can be monitored. GHC is written in 
Python (with Flask) under the umbrella of the GeoPython GitHub Organization. It is currently an OSGeo Community Project. 

GHC consists of a web-UI through which OGC service endpoint URLs and their checks can be managed, 
and monitoring-results can be inspected, plus a monitoring engine that executes scheduled "health-checks" on OGC service endpoints. 
A database stores results, allowing for various forms of reporting.

GHC is extensible: a plugin-system is available for "Probes" to support an expanding number of 
cases for OGC specific requests and -checks. Work is in progress to provide a GHC API for various integrations.

                <abstract>HOT's LAC hub dedicates an important part of its activities to foster mapping and collaborative projects in the Amazon, with different academic and civil partners, and with the regional Openstreetmap community including its large student community, in continuity with OSM-Latam's Mapazonia initiative. 
The Amazonia Program is a multifaceted initiative that addresses mapping gaps and promotes social impact mapping in the region. Partnerships with disaster risk management, civil protection and municipal development authorities aim to fill mapping gaps and improve the risk management and sustainable development, including preservation, of this critical region for the world. Early mapping identifies vulnerable areas to improve planning and response and make degradation processes visible. The community projects teach mapping and support environmental monitoring in several Amazonian cities and communities in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia, fostering local engagement and open data ownership.
The set of projects develops technical competencies with the great diversity of actors that have a role in the management of their territory (governments, communities, ancestral governments, civil society, supported by universities), based on the use of free and collaborative geographic data (OSM) and “low tech” mapping and monitoring tools, also free, culturally relevant, and with low connectivity requirements. 
In this talk we will explain the long term strategy to map the Amazon, will exemplify different projects, show the challenges for the region, and show the different mappings that the audience can join and invite their own communities.
This talk will serve as an introduction to a practical activity that will be proposed to contribute to the mapping of Belém.</abstract>

                <abstract>Fisheries' sustainability should be achieved by considering biological, social and economic aspects. To this end, different strategies should be followed, including co-management, which encourages scientists, governments, fishers and civil society to jointly manage the ocean resources. Since 2014, several co-management strategies have been implemented in Catalonia, a region with about 580 km of coast in the NW Mediterranean Sea. With the aim to transfer scientific knowledge to better manage the ecosystem, we present here the end-to-end (E2E) system from ICATMAR, the Catalan Institute of Research for the Governance of the Seas. The E2E system includes data collection, processing, analysis, publication and web visualization of bottom trawling and purse seine fisheries sampling data along the Catalan coast. In 2023, all these fisheries represented 85% of the total catch and 77% of the total fisheries revenue of the region.

During 5 years of data collection (2019-2023), the sampling program created a dataset of over 1,500 onboard samplings and 1 million sampled specimens of more than 470 different species. As the combination of environmental data with fisheries monitoring brings new approaches to assess the status of the ecosystem, the collected fisheries data, jointly with the daily fishing landings and Vessel Monitoring System (VMS), are all visualized in combination with georeferenced sea habitats (EMODnet), and climate and sea conditions (CMEMS) on the web browser. An open website (www.icatmar.cat) offers the following data visualizations: geolocalized fisheries samplings together with the mentioned data sources, biomass distribution per port or season, and length-frequency charts per species (https://icatmar.github.io/VISAP). To better implement fisheries management strategies, these E2E information systems may be used as a tool to access high-quality open data, facilitate their comprehension and ease the dialogue between science, fisheries, policymakers and civil society.</abstract>

                <abstract>The modern Python geospatial stack encompasses several tools and libraries that allow scientists and developers to write more efficient and scalable data science workflows, from data access and preparation, to analysis and visualization. It provides a great ecosystem for reading and writing cloud-optimized and chunked data formats, accessing data catalogs, handling labeled N-dimensional arrays, parallel and distributed computing, statistical analysis, machine learning, and interactive computing and plotting.

As data scientists increasingly work in teams and tackle bigger and more complex problems, there is a growing need for collaborative platforms that can support sophisticated workflows and large-scale data processing. However, platforms for effective collaboration still have significant challenges, including deployment, configuration, graceful scaling, and environment and dependency management. Addressing these challenges is not trivial and it often requires some DevOps expertise.

In this talk, we’ll introduce Nebari, a cloud-based open source data science platform built on top of Kubernetes, Dask and the Jupyter ecosystem. Nebari enables organizations to quickly deploy a collaborative platform on any of the major cloud providers. Once deployed, teams can easily access single-user Jupyter Notebook and VS Code servers from their web browsers and start writing and running reproducible and scalable geospatial data science workflows. Integrated with conda-store and Dask, it provides users not only the possibility to build, share and access conda environments from their servers, but also to launch short-lived clusters to handle their compute-intensive tasks.

We’ll demonstrate how Nebari can be leveraged to develop compute and data intensive applications in the cloud using packages from the modern Python geospatial stack. By the end, we hope to equip organizations with the tools and knowledge to promote better and more effective collaboration in geospatial data science. Organizations can choose to adopt Nebari as an out-of-the box platform for their teams, or use it as a blueprint for developing a custom platform built on top of open source libraries.</abstract>

                <title>MAPi: Web Mapping Platform for Education and Urban Planning</title>
                <subtitle />
                <type>Talk</type>

                <abstract>MAPi is a web platform for online mapping conceived as a public participation tool for schools and organized civil society. Its main functionalities of visualization, analysis, and collection of spatial data were developed to encourage participatory urban planning, especially focusing students and teachers from basic education.
The Center for Metropolitan Studies (CEM), which is the research center that hosts MAPi´s project, has been responsible for producing and openly sharing databases (cartographic and non-cartographic) since its inception 20 years ago.  More recently, CEM expanded its activities in this technology transfer area to develop interactive web systems, like ReSolution and Schools portals, built from the interaction with the center's academic research work and agendas. So the idea is to bridge the gap between highly complex research and technology transfer to academic and non-academic society, respecting the principle of open data and software. All data produced and all softwares developed, including its source codes, are available at no cost.
In this context, however, there is a great challenge to make the knowledge produced by the CEM, especially the cartographic databases, continuously accessible to a portion of society that does not master geospatial analysis techniques. Although the ecosystem that provides tools for this type of analysis is increasingly more accessible, including through the web, they are still far from being widely adopted in non-specialized contexts, such as classrooms.
To tackle this challenge, MAPi arises to perform as a tool that can expand the use of spatial data in primary and secondary schools. So it has the twofold challenge of gathering simplicity in its navigation to ensure a friendly experience with complexity of technique specificities of exploring and visualizing spatial data,  especially for the non-specialized public.
Thus, MAPi has, since its first version, native integration with CEM's spatial data repository, GeoCEM, which is developed based on the GeoNode software, with its metadata stored on Geoserver..
Through Geonode, MAPi queries the layers that are published on GeoServer using the Web Feature Service (WFS). WFS specifies an interface for accessing and manipulating geographic elements using the HTTP protocol. The advantage and reason for choosing this standard is its ability to extract only the desired data at the element and attribute level. In this way, we can build a dynamic platform that creates thematic maps in real-time from the parameters chosen by the user, characterizing it as an interactive mapping platform.
MAPi presents as its main tool for spatial data analysis the interface for creating choropleth thematic maps. This type of map is used in MAPi to represent data collected from geographic units such as census tracts and districts. For this functionality, the platform allows the choice between some color palettes (sequential, divergent, or qualitative), which are associated with the polygons of the geographic units according to the class division (quantile or natural breaks). The selection of multiple spatial data layers that are added as a Vector Tile layer in OpenLayers, makes it possible for the user to analyze and compare different themes or periods simultaneously. To serve non-specialized audiences, we maintain only the most essential tools of thematic mapping so that users can in a few steps build visualizations capable of extracting analyses, maintaining some level of parameterization to adapt to the type of phenomenon. Thus, through the OpenLayers and WFS resources, we make parameterizable for each layer its visibility, the attribute that will be associated with the fill color, the data classification method, the color palette, and the attributes that will be displayed in the dynamic map legend (based on attribute values).
Finally, the third axis of functionality, collaborative mapping, aims to provide, in a simplified way, tools for the production of spatial data. We understand here that this functionality can be a tool that enables the expansion and updating of data coverage that official agencies are unable to perform. In this way, we intend to create an area within the platform that allows the creation of forms with location fields to create spatial data to be viewed and analyzed together with the other data on the platform. Currently, only the integration with Mapillary partially accomplishes this goal through the consumption of the visualization of the cover layer, and visualization of the photo sequences available in Mapillary by its users.
One potential application in education from collaborative mapping functionalities is the support in the discussion about neighborhood plans, that are  instruments foreseen under master plan development, like the example from the megacity of São Paulo. The tool is under test with basic education teachers that want to promote mapping activities with MAPi in urban geography classes, and also within mathematics classes where they can address methodological issues of the results of this mapping to support basic concepts related to statistics in the classroom. Our next challenges are the optimization of performance for large volumes of data and the implementation of more complex collaborative mapping functionalities in a Agile methodology, with constant interaction with teachers that envision MAPi´s potential to foster engagement of students in urban planning.</abstract>

                <abstract>UNICEF is leveraging geospatial technologies in order to geo-enable UNICEF’s data, systems and processes to transform data into easily accessible, readily available and actionable geospatial information. Such information is essential to address key questions, such as: “How many children are affected by climate change?”, “Where children have limited access to schools AND limited access to health services?” to support evidence-based advocacy and decision-making for better results for children.
UNICEF has adopted a hybrid geospatial architecture, benefiting from both commercial and open-source GIS solutions. Open-source approach allows us to have more flexibility and enables cost-effective scalability of corporate GIS systems, making them available to all UNICEF users.
GeoSight is an open-source web geospatial data platform developed by UNICEF for easy data visualization and analysis. It is specifically designed to simplify the creation of online maps for visualizing multiple indicators at a subnational level to support evidence-based decision-making. Using GeoSight, UNICEF users and partners can easily overlay multiple indicators representing various thematic areas, such as natural hazards, climate-related risks, but also conflicts, health, education, poverty and other socio-economic indicators.
GeoSight is developed using Django backend and React at a frontend. It has a robust backend interface where users can manage indicator data, basemaps, contextual layers, styles as well as create new projects (dashboards) for publishing data. A dashboard is the main GeoSight product for end-users to interact with the data. It is consists of an interactive map (developed using MapLibre) with multiple indicator layers representing various statistics, typically at national or subnational levels. Indicator layers can be queried and analyzed at different administrative levels (e.g. province or district) at a specific date and time. Additionally, users can cross-query multiple indicators using filters. The map may also contain contextual layers (which can be any point, line, polygon or raster layers) as well as custom basemaps. 
GeoSight has a robust API that allows for system-to-system integrations. This is a powerful feature, which is used for creating automated data pipelines that feed in data from multiple sources and make them available for all users.
GeoSight is a self-service platform that equips UNICEF users at all country offices with an easy to use and powerful geospatial analytical system. The platform has been already used to support UNICEF response in many emergency contexts, including Ukraine and Gaza. It is also used as a dissemination tool for global and regional initiative such as Child Climate Risk Index-Disaster Risk Model (CCRI-DRM), WASH Insecurity Analysis (WIA) and many others.
“UNICEF has over 70-year history of innovating for children and believes that new approaches, partnerships, and technologies that support the realization of children’s rights are critical to improving their lives. Early on, UNICEF established guiding principles for innovation and technology in development, which influences the Principles for Digital Development. One of these – Use Open Standards, Open Data, Open Source, and Open Innovation – explicitly advocates for the licensing of open source software to enable greater impact in international development and cooperation. This Principle has guided UNICEF’s approach in creating, investing in, and supporting innovations” (https://www.unicef.org/innovation/dpg-pathfinding-countries). Following this principle, UNICEF has made GeoSight source code publicly available under the terms of an AGPL-3.0 license.
Open source approach is also one of the key elements of the Frontier Data Network - UNICEF’s strategic initiative designed to promote innovation and capacity building in data science, helping us make data-driven decisions that truly benefit children. Open source solutions are part of how we offer the underlying capabilities that are necessary to actually enable the production and provision of solutions.
We believe that GeoSight can benefit many organizations, both private, NGOs and public, not only in the humanitarian and development sectors. We would like to encourage organizations and individual developers to contribute to GeoSight project and help us and our partners leverage open-source geospatial technology to support the lives of children around the world.</abstract>

                <abstract>This talk will cover some of the following areas:
1. An overview of Mapillary.
2. Who is contributing and some interesting case studies.
3. Some of the recent updates including 2.0 mobile apps, NeRFs, and improved upload.
4. How to contribute including cameras, upload tools, and best practices.
5. How to download data using Mapillary's web interface and API.

Since Mapillary launched in 2013, over 2 billion images have been contributed from places as far afield as Antarctica and Zimbabwe. Images can be uploaded from any device that creates geotagged images, from affordable smartphones to commercial grade 360° cameras. 

Every image is processed with computer vision to recreate the world in 3D and extract features that are useful for map making. These capabilities have attracted all sorts of map builders including advocates for pedestrian safety, humanitarian agencies, state and local transportation departments, OpenStreetMap contributors, ridesharing companies and more.

In this talk we’ll recap Mapillary for those that are less familiar, sharing some more recent case studies to help crystalize the utility of street-level imagery. We’ll then cover some of the platform changes of 2024, including the launch of the revised mobile apps (2.0). This leads into our latest recommendations for how to capture and upload street-level imagery effectively. We’ll conclude with a look at how you can download map features using the web interface and Python tools.</abstract>

                <abstract>HOT's humanitarian program brings together different types of actions that leverage the OpenStreetMap database and its ecosystem of tools to provide local actors, including organizations and governments, with data required in the immediacy of crisis response to natural disasters and other humanitarian situations.  Data creation aims to be timely through a rapid but accurate assessment with local sectors of their most pressing needs for immediate response, intermediate response and then recovery, a phase that can last more than a year after a disaster.  It is a comprehensive process co-designed with local stakeholders and collaborative with all local, regional and global mapping communities interested in this humanitarian issue invited to participate. It includes a certain type of standardized phases, but revisited and prioritized according to needs with high care to people's vulnerability and to the privacy of certain information. 
This talk will exemplify the support that HOT is giving in the state of Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil and in particular in the city of Porto Alegre since July 2024. 
In this area of the country, the city government in particular has been helped to have a faster recovery of its educational and health social services, an indirect but concrete way to improve the welfare of the population, with geographic data and open technologies.</abstract>

                <abstract>The integration of a Human Rights-Based Approach to Data (HRBAD) with open-source geospatial and remote sensing data presents a powerful tool for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) while ensuring no one is left behind. This talk/presentation will explore how HRBAD principles can be applied to open geospatial data, focusing on use cases and applications that enhance our understanding of human rights issues and support evidence-based policy-making.
I will introduce the concept of HRBAD, emphasizing its six key principles: participation, data disaggregation, self-identification, transparency, privacy, and accountability. I'll then try to demonstrate how these principles align with and can be implemented in open-source geospatial and remote sensing data initiatives.

The presentation will showcase several key use cases and applications:

Participatory Mapping for Inclusive Development: Examples of how platforms like OpenStreetMap enable marginalized communities to contribute to data collection, improving accuracy and empowering advocacy efforts.
Disaggregated Geospatial Analysis for Inequality Assessment: Demonstrating how fine-grained spatial analysis using open satellite imagery can reveal patterns of inequality, supporting the HRBAD principle of data disaggregation.
Transparent Earth Observation for Environmental Justice: exploring the applications of open satellite data for monitoring environmental changes and holding actors accountable for degradation affecting marginalized communities.
Capacity Building through Open Geospatial Education: exploring initiatives that use open data and tools to educate and empower communities in using geospatial technologies for advocacy.

I will discuss how these applications relate to HRBAD principles and consider some of the challenges in using open geospatial data for human rights applications. This includes touching on issues of data quality and accessibility.

The presentation will suggest ways to incorporate HRBAD principles into open geospatial data initiatives, offering practical considerations for data collection, analysis, and dissemination that align with human rights principles.

Through these examples, I hope to illustrate the potential of combining open-source geospatial data with a human rights-based approach, and how this could contribute to more inclusive and effective sustainable development efforts.

This presentation aims to interest professionals from various fields, including geospatial science, human rights, development, policy, and data science. It hopes to encourage further dialogue on the use of open geospatial data in human rights and sustainable development contexts and on applying HRBA to open-source geospatial data.</abstract>

                <abstract>The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into various operational and strategic sectors marks a significant shift in the way data is managed and analyzed. In the geospatial context as in many others, usage of generative AI radically changes the way the user can interact with the platform, bringing new use cases and decoupling the value that we can get out of the data catalogs.

In this presentation, we will quickly cover the generative AI principles (Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models, etc…) and what it can bring to the geospatial ecosystem in terms of usages. 

We will then dive into more specific examples, explain how it works and how we can set them up into existing applications
- Enrich data readability and findability from unstructured data
- Improve search with Semantic or Hybride search
- Bring natural language conversation for easy interactions within the platforms
- Analyze data for a better understanding and outcome

These examples and demonstrations are based on Free and Open Source geospatial solutions and rely on OGC standards. 

Hopefully, the presentation will give your a new perspective about what generative AI can bring to your data and your catalogs, with great insights and concrete applications.</abstract>

                <abstract>The effective management and utilization of water data are critical for both community engagement and scientific analysis. To address the challenges associated with disparate data formats and standards, this presentation explores the use of unifying standards such as WaterML2.0 and OGC API Environmental Data Retrieval (EDR). These standards offer a cohesive approach to data exchange and interoperability, bridging gaps between diverse use cases and technical requirements.

Water data is highly diverse—spanning vector geospatial features, time series, raster data, and combinations thereof. The Internet of Water (IoW) Coalition advocates for data equity and interoperability, emphasizing the adoption of standardized formats and web services to drive both data science and equitable decision making. Using pygeoapi as a testbed, this session will focus on two primary use cases: community engagement through web applications and modeling &amp; analysis for water resource management.

Use Case 1: Web App Development for Community Engagement and Education
For public-facing applications, ease of use and accessibility are paramount. Here, JSON-based formats like GeoJSON and CoverageJSON are evaluated for their effectiveness in representing water data. The session will demonstrate how CoverageJSON provides a streamlined approach to handling time series and geospatial data, aligning with web development needs and enhancing user engagement through interactive, map-oriented interfaces.

Use Case 2: Scientific Analysis for Water Resource Management
Scientific platforms require comprehensive data exchange and metadata standards to support robust analysis. WaterML2.0, with its detailed metadata and extensive schema, is well-suited for this purpose. However, its XML serialization poses challenges for modern software development workflows and analytical tools. We discuss potential solutions, including a proposed JSON serialization of WaterML2.0 and its integration with OGC API - EDR for data queries and access. 

We will address the trade-offs between these standards, considering factors such as data complexity, metadata requirements, and web compatibility. Recommendations will be made for future development, including enhancements to existing standards and the creation of best practice specifications for effective water data exchange.</abstract>

                <duration>00:30</duration>
                <abstract>Since 2013, the Brazilian Army Geographic Service has been committed to migrating its geospatial production into Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). DSGTools, a QGIS plugin released in 2015, is a result of this effort. Currently in version 4.14.0, DSGTools’ features have been used to produce massive amounts of spatial data and have been consolidated as the Brazilian Army’s official geospatial production suite.

DSGTools offers features such as database creation according to the Brazilian cartographic legislation, layer loading with resolved domains and easy WMS service access from BDGEx, the Brazilian Army Geographic Service SDI. In addition, DSGTools offers a wide range of extraction tools such as the right angle digitalization tool, the free hand digitalization tool, the generic selection tool, the raster selection tool, the feature inspection tool, the DSGTools Processing Algorithm Provider and the Geospatial Data Quality Assurance Toolbox (QA Toolbox), which is one of the standout features of DSGTools.

The QA Toolbox runs processes called workflows, which consists of a series of interconnected sequential tasks based on QGIS models executed in a predefined sequence. For each step in this sequence, the QA Toolbox executes a geospatial data processing task, ranging from data cleaning and identification of data inconsistencies.

Moreover, the primary objective of the QA Toolbox is to automate the identification and correction of geospatial data issues introduced during the data extraction process. The execution of a workflow is carried out sequentially, stopping only in specific cases, depending on the configuration chosen by the user. A workflow can have its execution halted when spatial inconsistencies called flags are produced after a model is executed. If a flag is raised during the execution of a workflow, the process halts immediately, prompting users to address the identified issue before proceeding. The QA Toolbox also prevents users from forcing the execution of followup tasks without fixing the flags raised in the current step. By forcing the users to correct the errors pointed out before continuing the process,  the propagation of unhandled inconsistencies is prevented.

The DSGTools Geospatial Data Quality Assurance Toolbox usage can reduce the required time and effort invested on geospatial data production. Users can also create complex workflows that operate independently. The use of a predefined sequence of models ensures that each step in the data processing is performed consistently, following standardized procedures like the Brazilian Standards of Geospatial Data Production set by the National Infrastructure of Spatial Data (INDE). This consistency is crucial for maintaining high-quality geospatial datasets, especially in large-scale projects. The flagging mechanism is a key component of the Brazilian Army Geographic Service’s production line, ensuring that errors are promptly addressed and preventing the accumulation of issues that could compromise the overall quality of the dataset.

Additionally, the execution status of the DSGTools Geospatial Data Quality Assurance Toolbox can be saved within the user’s project, allowing the QA process to be carried out over multiple days. Since DSGTools workflows are built using QGIS models, they harness the full power of the QGIS processing toolbox and various plugins, including the 159 processes available in the DSGTools Processing Algorithm Provider.

In this talk, we will showcase all the DSGTools Geospatial Data Quality Assurance Toolbox features and highlight its usage in real-world use cases of geospatial data production. DSGTools is available at the QGIS Plugin Repository, and its code is hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/dsgoficial/DsgTools.</abstract>

                <abstract>PDAL is Point Data Abstraction Library. It is a C/C++ open source library and applications for translating and processing point cloud data. It is not limited to LiDAR data, although the focus and impetus for many of the tools in the library have their origins in LiDAR. PDAL allows you to compose operations on point clouds into pipelines of stages. These pipelines can be written in a declarative JSON syntax or constructed using the available API. This talk will focus on the current state of the PDAL Pointcloud processing library and related projects such as COPC and Entwine, for pointcloud processing. Coverage of the most common filters, readers and writers along with some general introduction on the library, coverage of processing models, language bindings and command line based batch processing. First part will be covering new features for current users. Some discussion of installation method including Docker, binaries from package repositories, and Conda packaging.

                <abstract>The State of California has a recurring issue of devastating wildfires that spread out of control, causing significant damage to the wellbeing of its citizens, its environment and economy.

Due to this recurring issue, the State of California and the USDA—United States Forest Service committed to applying treatments to one million acres of land (roughly 400,000 hectares), with the goal of reducing the occurrence and severity of these wildfires. Planscape was created as a tool to prioritize and guide this one million-acre effort.

Planscape is a freely available tool built to help landscape planners, public agents and the general public prioritize and learn about landscape interventions that can minimize fire risk and cost while maximizing ecological benefits. 

Planscape uses linear optimization algorithms and over 200 datasets produced by the California Wildfire &amp; Forest Resilience Task Force to determine the priority locations for applying landscape treatments such as mastication, prescribed burns, and others.

This talk aims to outline why and how Planscape is being built by Spatial Informatics Group, with an in-depth description of the technologies in use, software architecture, data handling (pre-processing, usage, post-processing), and an overview of our current goals and challenges.

Ultimately, we will demonstrate how government agencies can leverage Planscape to implement similar optimizations in your community, county, state, or country.</abstract>

                <abstract>18 years ago, OpenLayers was the first alternative to Google Maps, with the ability to display layers from open data sources. Today, Leaflet, Mapbox GL JS and MapLibre can do the same. OpenLayers has found its niche as a full-featured, flexible, and high-performance geospatial JavaScript library that users can count on for the long haul, especially when their mapping needs get more complex.

This talk will provide you with a tour of the latest features in the library, including daring live demonstrations. We will present our recent and ongoing work on adding new features and making the library more fun to work with.

Whether you're a developer or decision maker, come to this talk to learn about the current status of OpenLayers. We’ll provide you with a glimpse into the future of the library and leave you motivated to get mapping with OpenLayers.</abstract>

                <abstract>Introduction:

FOSS4G (Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial) 2024 will be a platform to present innovative and accessible solutions that use free and open-source software for geospatial information management. In this proposal, we highlight the importance of using FOSS to reduce costs, automate processes, and simplify operations in QGIS, with a special focus on applications for large and environmentally sensitive areas such as the Amazon. Our presentation will detail the implementation of the GeoRondônia project and the use of the GeoINCRA plugin in QGIS, emphasizing its benefits in land regularization and environmental sustainability.

GeoRondônia Project - Land Regularization and Environmental Sustainability:

The GeoRondônia project is a partnership between the Federal Institute of Education, Science, and Technology of Rondônia (IFRO) and the National Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform (INCRA), through the Decentralized Execution Term (TED) No. 20/2021/DF/SEDE/INCRA-IFRO. With a duration of 48 months, the project aims to title rural properties in 120 Settlement Projects (PAs), covering a perimeter of 31,000 km and benefiting more than 20,000 families in 26 municipalities. The actions include georeferencing, perimeter demarcation, parceling, occupational supervision, and the Rural Environmental Registry (CAR). With an investment of approximately 23 million reais, GeoRondônia has already benefited about 15,000 families, standing out as a model of efficiency and economy.

Importance of FOSS in Geospatial Projects:

Rondônia has 222 Settlement Projects, with approximately 66,000 rural properties, and a large part is being served by the GeoRondônia project. However, the biggest obstacle is data processing, which involves large volumes and complexity. Therefore, the project sought ways to optimize processes and speed up the achievement of goals within established deadlines, finding in QGIS+GeoINCRA the tools needed for this objective.
Adopting free and open-source software (FOSS) is essential to reduce costs and increase the accessibility of geospatial technologies. Software like QGIS offers a robust and flexible platform for implementing georeferencing and land registration projects, eliminating the need for expensive licenses and allowing the customization of tools according to the specific needs of the projects. With the savings generated in the GeoRondônia project using QGIS and the GeoINCRA plugin, it was possible to direct resources and optimize other processes in the project. Additionally, the solution created using these applications can be replicated to all Brazilian states.

GeoINCRA Plugin: Simplifying Georeferencing in QGIS:

The GeoINCRA plugin was developed to optimize the georeferencing process of rural properties according to INCRA's technical standards. Implemented in Python, the plugin integrates with QGIS's processing framework, offering functionalities that automate data querying, attribute filling, and document generation required for land certification. The main tools of the plugin include:
Load Vertex Layer - Loads selected features from a point layer into the vertices layer of the GeoINCRA database; Download ODS Spreadsheet from SIGEF - Generates an empty ODS spreadsheet for later filling; Query INCRA Database - Connects to INCRA's database to query land assets and generate vector layers; CSV from INCRA to PointZ Layer - Transforms CSV vertex files from INCRA into PointZ layers; GeoINCRA to TopoGeo - Copies features from the GeoINCRA database layers to the TopoGeo database, facilitating the generation of descriptive memorials and topographic maps; Generate TXT for ODS Spreadsheet - Creates a text file with data needed to fill the SIGEF ODS spreadsheet; Fill Vertex Code - Automatically fills the vertex code attribute in the GeoINCRA database's vertex layer, easing the work of the georeferencing professional.

Methodology and Results:

The adopted methodology includes the modeling of geospatial data in a Geopackage database, the implementation of a plugin in QGIS, and the integration of these elements to optimize the georeferencing workflow. The GeoINCRA database was designed to store topographic data in a standardized and integrated manner, while the GeoINCRA plugin automates processes that traditionally would be manual and prone to errors.
The results achieved with the use of QGIS+GeoINCRA are: Automation of ODS spreadsheets that were previously done manually; Reduction of the time to prepare the spreadsheets by 80%, as the spreadsheets are generated in bulk, i.e., hundreds of plots can be generated at once; Elimination of topological errors that were only seen when trying to insert the data into SIGEF (INCRA's georeferencing platform); Elimination of errors in textual attributes (spelling errors); Savings for the project, without the need to purchase licenses.
The results obtained demonstrate that the combined use of the GeoINCRA database and the GeoINCRA plugin results in greater productivity, better data standardization, and elimination of software license costs. This approach facilitates access for small companies and professionals to the georeferencing market, aligning with federal government policies on the use of FOSS and promoting independence and public resource savings.

Who Benefits from the GeoINCRA+QGIS Solution:

The presentation at FOSS4G 2024 will highlight how the use of FOSS, exemplified by QGIS and the GeoINCRA plugin, can transform georeferencing projects for a diverse range of stakeholders. This includes government agencies, environmental organizations, and small surveying companies, particularly in vast and environmentally critical areas like the Amazon. By reducing costs, automating processes, and ensuring high-quality results, these solutions significantly contribute to land regularization, environmental sustainability, and socio-economic development in the region. This approach ensures that even resource-constrained entities can efficiently manage geospatial data and meet regulatory requirements.</abstract>

                <abstract>The proposal consists of the presentation of the benefits that can be obtained by the implementation of a Topology for Spatial Distribution Networks. The concepts of Topology, the steps necessary for its implementation and the benefits for an organization are presented. Finally, the project is presented where, from a Plugin developed in Python in QGIS, the implemented resources and the results obtained are demonstrated. The full content of the Project can be viewed in these two articles:

•	https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/topologia-de-rede-espacializada-rodrigo-paschoal-do-valle-wx7hf/?trackingId=gNxyrwDYR1ahkTMHJEN%2FzA%3D%3D

•	https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/topologia-rede-de-saneamento-rodrigo-paschoal-do-valle-uxblf/?trackingId=1UOrKCOaQcmffR9BqAnqcQ%3D%3D

Initially, the concepts and steps necessary for the elaboration of Topology will be presented in a simple and objective way. A Water Distribution Network (Sanitation) will be used as an example, as its elements are easy to see. Three main elements will be addressed:

•	Segments: representing the distribution network.
•	Valves: representing the point at which the flow can be interrupted.
•	Reservoir: representing the starting point of the network (start of supply).

For each element, its characteristics (SYNTAX) and behaviors (SEMANTICS) will be presented. The analysis focuses on simplifying the model, meeting what is necessary for the development of the resources that will be explored in Topology.

After the contextualization of the Topology, some challenges faced during its implementation will be presented. Emphasizing the eventual necessary adjustment in the registered elements, as examples:

•	Unconnected segments: adequacy of the initial and final vertices to establish the connection.
•	Valves superimposed on segments: division of the segment and insertion of valve between them.
•	Unconnected reservoirs: adequacy of the segment vertex to establish the connection.

The benefits obtained and the ability to increase the maturity of an organization are addressed, as static records are transformed into active elements, enabling maneuvers, validations and behavior analysis. Thus, we have the development of Network Intelligence. These and other benefits will be addressed in preparation for the presentation of the results developed in the Project.

The project had two stages: In the first, a Natural Gas Distribution Network was used on which the Network Isolation mechanism was implemented; in the second, a Water Distribution Network was used and new resources were implemented: Network Analysis, Network Status and Opening and Closing of Valves. The presentation will focus on the advantages obtained by the implemented resources, demonstrating the characteristics and applications of each one.

For the presentation of the implemented resources, images and videos will be used, as well as made in the published articles.

&lt;u&gt;Step 1: Contextualization of the Gas Distribution case&lt;/u&gt;
•	&lt;b&gt;Network Isolation:&lt;/b&gt; need to isolate the section in an Emergency situation (Leak)
Presentation of the results and concepts involved: Selected Segment, Isolated Section, Affected Section and Valves to be closed.

Emphasis also on future benefits related to isolation:
•	Identification of Customers Affected in the maneuvers performed.
•	Identification of Critical Regions in which a one-off isolation affects a vast region.
•	Analysis of existing resources in a Graph structure: (1) identification of critical paths, (2) analysis of points without supply redundancy, (3) automatic assignment of the status of segments from the manipulation of valves.
•	Assistance in Supply Continuity Strategies, identifying Critical Customers (such as Hospitals) that are in vulnerable regions.

&lt;u&gt;Step 2: Contextualization of the Sanitation case and implemented resources&lt;/u&gt;
•	&lt;b&gt;Network Analysis: &lt;/b&gt;an analysis is made on the imported elements to identify inconsistencies, thus validating the model. The following situations were analyzed: (1) Valves connected to only one Segment, (2) Valves connected to more than two Segments, (3) Segments isolated from the Network, (4) Segments not connected to Reservoirs, and (5) Isolated Valves and Reservoirs. This analysis can be expanded, according to the elements and rules used by Topology, and can also help in estimating the effort required in adjusting records.

•	&lt;b&gt;Network Status: &lt;/b&gt;from the connections between Reservoirs, Segments and Registers (open and closed) the points of the Network that are Supplied and Not Supplied are presented. With this functionality, the status of a certain stretch is automatically defined, thus not requiring the intervention of an operator to update the Network. The feature has the same behavior for Gas Networks, respecting the elements of Topology.

•	&lt;b&gt;Opening and Closing of Valves: &lt;/b&gt;after analyzing the Network, it is possible to select the Valves and open/close them, automatically updating the network. This feature is especially important for situations where we need to analyze the impact on the Network of maneuvers performed. This feature can be used in conjunction with Network Isolation to study the behavior of the distribution fabric.

&lt;b&gt;Next steps&lt;/b&gt;
•	Include the list of Affected Customers in the resources already developed.
•	Explore opportunities for new resources, some with room to be used by any Distribution Network, others that make sense only for certain contexts;
•	Use of the model (BDGD) – Geographic Database of the Distributor, required by ANEEL (National Electric Energy Agency) for the delivery of data from the concessionaires, including an Electric Energy Distribution Network to the project;
•	Prospect any use case related to Telecommunications Networks.

&lt;b&gt;Conclusion&lt;/b&gt;
In this second example, the Water Distribution Concessionaire urgently needed to resupply Hospitals in a certain region of Porto Alegre. As alternatives were implemented, a number of houses and buildings also had their supply normalized. In this situation, only critical points should be supplied, directing the scarce resource only to emergency points. Network Topology enables this maneuver and the creation of strategies for network segmentation.</abstract>

                <abstract>Open-source software has become increasingly crucial for the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and its Members, particularly those in developing countries, Least Developed Countries (LDCs), and Small Island Developing States (SIDS).  The potential of open source can enable climate action for adaptation, while also addressing the challenges and opportunities presented by the current landscape of open-source development within the WMO.

Open-source solutions also play a pivotal role as accelerators for the implementation of Early Warnings for All, a key UN initiative in which WMO is playing a critical role, aimed at protecting every person on Earth with life-saving early warning systems by 2027. By providing accessible, customizable, and cost-effective tools, open-source software enables WMO Members to rapidly deploy and adapt early warning systems to their specific needs and contexts. This approach is particularly crucial for developing countries, LDCs and SIDS, where resource constraints often hinder the implementation of proprietary solutions.

Moreover, open-source initiatives serve as powerful catalysts in supporting WMO Members' efforts towards digital transformation. As National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs) worldwide strive to modernize their operations and services, open-source tools offer a flexible and scalable foundation for innovation. They enable Members to leverage cutting-edge technologies, collaborate on development, and share best practices, thus accelerating their digital transformation journeys while optimizing resource utilization.

For many years, WMO has been actively involved in developing and supporting open-source software as a low-barrier, low-cost solution for its Members. These efforts, combined with comprehensive training and mentoring activities, have been met with enthusiasm and success.

This presentation will provide an overview of Open Source at WMO, its significant use, current status and future plans for increased development and use of Open Source software to help lower the implementation barrier to data exchange of weather/climate/water/environmental data.

Join us as we explore how WMO is transforming global weather, water, and climate data sharing, and discover how this initiative, along with FOSS4G tools, is fostering collaboration, innovation, and societal benefits on a global scale, with a particular focus on supporting Climate Action and Early Warning for All.</abstract>

                <abstract>In an era where geographic data underpins critical decision-making across various sectors, the need for open, interoperable data systems has never been greater. This presentation explores the transformative potential of open data through the lens of Overture Maps Foundation. 

Overture Maps Foundation, established under The Linux Foundation in 2022, is developing enterprise grade, open map data as a shared resource. This fast-growing open data community enables companies, government agencies, and other entities to collaboratively build and maintain high-quality foundational map data in a more efficient and cost-effective way. With these base data available for use under open licensing, organizations can then focus on building their business-specific services and applications. Overture Maps' datasets act like a shared freeway, enabling innovation across sectors like local search, logistics, disaster recovery, environmental analysis, augmented reality, and automotive.

This initiative emphasizes interoperability, ensuring that data can be seamlessly integrated and utilized across different platforms and applications. Both interoperability and conflation are vital in collaborative environments where multiple organizations contribute data to ensure that data can be shared and accessed effectively as a unified resource. By leveraging open data and technologies, Overture Maps enables developers, researchers, and policymakers to build advanced geospatial solutions without the constraints of proprietary data silos. 

Join this discussion to learn about:

- Overture and its genesis. Mapping the entire world — with every community, street, building, home and attractions (even as they change) — is challenging for any single organization to tackle, and the cost to build and sustain that data continues to grow as the demand for better data increases. 

- Overture’s project scope. Overture is collaboratively building six global, open foundational data layers that can link to a near-infinite catalog of spatial data through a stable ID system. 

- Overture’s Global Entity Reference System (GERS). Data conflation and enabling data interoperability are the biggest obstacles in realizing the full value of the abundant open map data resources available today. Conflation in particular is a challenge given spatial and attribute ambiguities and discrepancies across datasets. With GERS, datasets built by different organizations can reference the same real-world map features in a simple, unambiguous way. 

This session will delve into the foundation's core principles, including the use of open-source tools, community-driven data contributions, and the implementation of best practices for data quality and governance. Attendees will gain insights into the technical architecture of Overture Maps, including its approach to data interoperability, and learn how to contribute to and benefit from this growing ecosystem. Come join us and learn about creating and using a single, coordinated, base map for the world!</abstract>

                <title>Building-Level Population Estimates Using Open Geospatial Data</title>

                <abstract>Geospatial analyses in social science applications depend fundamentally on the quality and resolution of the underlying population data. There have been several significant efforts (e.g. WorldPop, Meta’s population density maps, etc.) in population mapping using satellite imagery to estimate population and population density particularly in hard to access regions of the world. In more urban and mixed-use settings, these estimates may be biased. We can derive higher resolution of population estimates down to a building level in these contexts by leveraging additional information such as planning assessments, zoning, building heights, etc. 
In this project, we aimed to leverage open data to disaggregate population estimates down to a building level. Based on known open data sources, we began in the urban American context, starting with New York City. We compared estimates using Cadastral-based dasymetric mapping to high-resolution estimates from satellite imagery. Recent developments in open mapping, such as the addition of building heights in overture maps developed by Meta (presented at FOSS4G 2023), further enhance the quality of open data available to scale these to cities where open cadastral data might not be available. 
Building-level urban population estimates can improve studies that otherwise rely on aerial interpolation of the underlying data. One use case we are excited to explore is using these building-level estimates to understand the people at risk from earthquakes and other natural disasters, supporting ongoing work by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR) (presented at FOSS4G 2023).

This project was one we started exploring in late 2020 and the connections we made at the last FOSS4G have given it a new life by leveraging work shared by others in this community and discovering new applications/users for this work. We hope to talk about this project at FOSS4G 2024 as an interesting research study, but also to demonstrate the value of building in the open and sharing with the vibrant open geospatial community.</abstract>

                <abstract>There are multiple ways to download OpenStreetMap (OSM) data, this talk delves into the realm of OSM plugins for QGIS, empowering participants to leverage this valuable free and open source geospatial data in their projects. We'll explore core plugins like QuickMapServices and QuickOSM, guiding participants through the process of adding basemaps and downloading specific features using Overpass API queries. In addition, we'll discover the functionalities of third-party plugins like OSMDownloader, which enable users to download data by area or with custom queries. 
We will look at some use cases within the humanitarian sector where OSM plugins can be used to download data for disaster response, mapping vulnerable communities, and monitoring refugee camps. We will also look at some use cases for climate change actions where these plugins can be used to download forest cover for mapping and monitoring deforestation by tracking changes over time, assessing climate risk by downloading data e.g. elevation, land cover, proximity to water body which can be used to assess vulnerability to the impact of climate change such as floods, Sea level rise etc.
This talk will be beneficial to both novice and advanced QGIS users, it will equip participants with the tools to harness the potential of open source data using free and open source software in their geospatial workflows.</abstract>

                <abstract>Over the past 30 years, Argentina has experienced changes in its agricultural and urban development model that have drastically altered land use practices and patterns. (Palmisano, 2018; Pintos and Narodowski, 2012)

These changes have been associated with flooding in several regions (Pal et al., 2021; Pattison and Lane, 2012). In particular, the Lujan River basin has historically experienced extreme events.

In the global scale, prevails the expansion of capitalism by a process of accumulation by dispossession,  characterized by land privatization, expulsion of farmers, conversion or suppression of rights to the commons (Harvey, 2004).

The analysis of these changes in landuse requires information typically obtained from remote sensing, that is validated and complemented with sampling programs. The development of an updated landuse map is a basic tool to study territorial phenomena such as flooding events or land use change. Such a methodology would allow the information to be compared with previously collected data at different scales and time periods.

But geographic information, its format, or processing tools do not generally allow for its reuse or improvement, and are not necessarily openly/freely available. This type of data can be considered a digital commons and can be the subject of mercantilization processes. In fact, publicly produced information and processing tools should be publicly available to enforce knowledge construction. (Arsanjani, 2015; Duféal and Noucher 2017).

OpenStreetMap is the main framework for volunteered geographic information, and because it constitutes a standardized database, it also allows to be a preferred repository for contributions originating from research programs of universities and public organizations.. Recently has been registered as a public good by an agency affiliated to the United Nations (https://blog.openstreetmap.org/2024/02/05/osm-named-as-a-digital-public-good-by-un-affiliated-agency/)

Data contributed to OSM has already been used to create and validate land use and land cover maps in various regions (Arsanjani et al., 2013; Shultz et al., 2017).

In Argentina,  the local community of OSM users has added a significant amount of geographic information that could be used for land use analysis, which could be further expanded, especially in non-urban areas.
Since 2016, land use data in the middle basin of the Lujan river have been added to OSM as part of projects conducted by the National University of Lujan. Land use was visually assessed using satellite imagery and representative polygons were added with appropriate tags. Geometries were added preferably as multipolygons. Boundaries were drawn to avoid sharing nodes with the road and rail network.

The aim of this work is to present the development of an R package for the analysis of landuse data contributed to OSM. Subsequently, the goal is to increase the contribution of publicly generated information and its analysis tools in an open access format, such as those provided by OSM and R (R Core Team, 2023).

The package can be installed from its github repository https://github.com/aduhour/osmlanduseR.

The package is in an early stage of development and the features included are aimed at 1) download a set of land use related data from OSM using the overpass API. 2) Remove overlaps and measure polygon area. 3) Classify polygons by mapping OSM tags to user-defined classes that can be assimilated to Corine Land Cover classes or the FAO Land Cover Classification System (Schultz et al., 2017; Volante 2009) 4) Create a land use classification map.

                <abstract>Codeando Mexico is a Mexican non-profit organization, with 11 years of experience, that works with technology and data for the public good. Our goal is to build better societies by building and contributing to sustainable and useful tech / data projects. 
We strongly believe in participatory, community-led projects that leverage tech and data to find solutions for our societies’ most pressing issues. We have spent the last decade building sustainable digital tools, opening up our tech and data, collaborating with other teams and contributing to amazing open-source projects. 
As part of our work, we act as technical partners to communities that require assistance. We are aware that the communities themselves are the experts in the problems we are trying to solve. To do this, we mostly take advantage of great open-source digital tools that are already available. 
For this talk, we would like to present three projects, talk about the lessons learned and provide insights on how to better collaborate between communities. In these collaborations we face similar challenges: How to integrate different skill levels to crowdmapping projects? How to structure participation to ensure data quality? How to help our partners better communicate and amplify the job they are undertaking? How to find a common language? How to create better relationships between tech, data, and problem-focused communities?
Throughout the presentation we will talk about 3 projects:
8M Map - Collaboration to improve the workflow from mapping to visualization of the activities around the globe for the 8M Geochicas International Women's Day 2024. 
Mapea tu Cuadra (map your block) - A collaboration with URBE, a local collective of urbanists, to map security and micro mobility infrastructure in their neighborhoods. 
EcoZonas - Ongoing collaboration with WRI and the Wuppertal Institute to help neighborhoods map and identify climate disaster risks in their communities. 
We will showcase the technologies and lessons learned, as well as useful strategies to build better collaborations.</abstract>

                <abstract>A QGIS plugin repository functions as a centralized repository of tools designed to automate and simplify the daily tasks of GIS users. It serves as a hub where company employees and collaborators can access, share, and utilize these tools. This initiative has the additional benefit of enhancing productivity while also cultivating a culture of collaboration and innovation within the organization. In any organization that places a significant reliance on GIS, the efficiency and accuracy of geospatial data processing are of paramount importance. Geographic information system (GIS) teams encounter a number of challenges, including the necessity to perform repetitive tasks, to complete time-consuming data processing steps, and to develop custom tools that are not readily available in standard GIS software. These issues underscored the necessity for a solution that could automate repetitive tasks, provide custom tools tailored to specific needs, and facilitate easy sharing and collaboration among team members. As an open-source GIS platform, QGIS offers a robust plugin architecture that allows users to extend its functionality. 
To develop QGIS plugins, a development environment was established, comprising Python (the primary language for QGIS plugin development), QGIS itself, and the requisite libraries, including PyQt for GUI development, pandas, and requests. A version control system based on the Git distributed revision control system was implemented to facilitate the effective management of the codebase. With the development environment prepared, the coding of the plugins commenced. Each plugin was designed to address a specific task or workflow and they are organized by projects. For example, the data standardization plugin was developed to meet the requirements of Resolução ANM n° 142/2023, the automatic caves CAD file download was created through the use of a database PostGRESQL/PostGIS and an AWS connection, and a Drainage tool was developed to delineate and estimate flow given a pour point of interest and elevation data. The initial step in developing the plugin repository involved understanding the specific needs of the team. A series of meetings and surveys were conducted to gather requirements and identify the most pressing issues. Several team members were involved in the testing process, gathering feedback and making necessary improvements. This iterative process helped refine the plugins and make them robust.
The plugin repository was organized in a manner that was both clear and intuitive. Each plugin was organized in a directory, which contained the source code, documentation, and example datasets. This structure facilitated user navigation of the repository, enabling them to readily identify the tools they required. The Bitbucket platform was selected for hosting the repository due to its widespread use and intuitive interface, which provides a collaborative environment where team members can access the plugins, report issues, suggest enhancements, and contribute to the development process.
To integrate the repository with QGIS, a custom plugin server was incorporated into the QGIS software. The server enabled users to peruse the available plugins, install them with a single click, and receive updates automatically, thus ensuring that users could readily access and utilize the tools without leaving the QGIS environment. To optimize the adoption and efficacy of the plugins, training sessions and workshops were conducted for colleagues. These sessions encompassed the installation and utilization of the plugins, best practices for geospatial data processing, and strategies for integrating the tools into daily workflows.
The QGIS plugin repository has had a profound impact on the organization, delivering key benefits such as increased efficiency, enhanced accuracy, enhanced collaboration and knowledge sharing, and enhanced scalability. The automation of repetitive tasks has resulted in a notable reduction in the time and effort required for data processing, thereby enabling team members to direct their attention to tasks of greater critical importance. The implementation of bespoke analytical tools has enhanced the precision and dependability of geospatial analyses. The repository has fostered a collaborative environment in which team members can share their tools and expertise, thereby facilitating continuous improvement and innovation. The modular structure of the repository allows for the straightforward incorporation of new plugins, thereby ensuring that emerging needs and challenges can be addressed.
Considering the repository's success, several prospective developments have been proposed. These include the expansion of the plugin library through the development of new plugins to address additional tasks and workflows, the incorporation of advanced geospatial analytics such as machine learning and spatial statistics to further enhance capabilities, the linking of the QGIS plugins with other enterprise systems such as databases and web services to create a more integrated and efficient geospatial data infrastructure, and the encouragement of participation from the broader FOSS4G community through the sharing of plugins and contributions to the global repository of geospatial tools and solutions.</abstract>

                <abstract>Visualizing and analyzing large-scale geospatial datasets, such as Overture Maps' comprehensive global dataset containing more than 3 billion features grows more challenging as these datasets continue to expand in size and scale. This presentation introduces Lonboard, a cutting-edge open-source Python library designed to address this challenge by enabling fast, interactive geospatial vector data visualization within Jupyter notebooks.

Lonboard's exceptional performance and ease of use stem from its innovative architecture, built on four key technologies: deck.gl for GPU-accelerated rendering, GeoArrow for efficient in-memory representation, GeoParquet for optimized file storage, and anywidget for seamless Jupyter integration. This powerful combination allows Lonboard to move data from Python to JavaScript and then to the GPU with unprecedented efficiency.

Unlike existing solutions that rely on slower GeoJSON encoding, Lonboard employs a fully binary pipeline. It leverages GeoPandas as the primary user interface, internally managing conversions to GeoArrow and GeoParquet for efficient data transport and rendering. This approach not only accelerates data processing but also significantly reduces the data size transferred to the browser.

We will demonstrate Lonboard's capabilities using Overture Maps data, which is provided in GeoParquet format as monthly releases. This showcase will highlight how Lonboard's simple interface allows researchers and data scientists to effortlessly visualize and interact with cloud-native, optimized geospatial data at a global scale.</abstract>

                <abstract>Every day, almost 2.5 million edits are made in OpenStreetMap. To maintain the high quality and reliability of OSM data, keeping track of changes is crucial. In 2024, a new OSM data pipeline was built for [OSMCha](https://osmcha.org/), one of the main OpenStreetMap data validation tools. This pipeline is fully open-source, and it allows us to visualize and run data quality checks on each edit made on OSM. Besides the set of open-source tools and the Kubernetes deploy infrastructure, the resulting data is available for free under the AWS Open Data program. We’ll share how this new pipeline streamlines data integrity and enables developers to build downstream cloud-native applications to monitor the changes happening in OpenStreetMap. We will also demo Gradient, a web application that displays OSM edits using this new real-time OSM pipeline.</abstract>

                <abstract>In today's fast-paced, data-driven environment, organizations that use geospatial data for analysis are challenged by managing complex datasets and frequent updates. Geospatial data provides valuable context and information, enhancing applications in various domains such as logistics, urban planning, environmental monitoring, and marketing.
Traditionally, many organizations have relied on no-code geospatial software with click-based interfaces. Due to their accessibility and user-friendly interface, these tools allow team members to visualize and manipulate geospatial data without the need for programming knowledge. However, as data starts to become more complex, these tools often present scalability limitations, restricting the full potential of geospatial data applications.
This paper explores the benefits of transitioning to a hybrid approach by integrating Python and open-source geospatial libraries into the data processing phase of geospatial analysis. By presenting the possible advantages gained and providing a hands-on example of Python use in geospatial data, the aim of this paper is to demonstrate how Python can play a pivotal role in overcoming the limitations of no-code solutions.
Python can enhance the data extraction phase, enabling integration with various data sources and APIs and connecting to external databases and web services. This capability supports consistent data exchange and real-time data integration. This phase can also be automated, summarizing all steps into a script that can be applied to every new dataset.
The processed data can be visualized using various libraries in a Python environment or used as input for traditional geospatial software. The hybrid approach leverages the user-friendly visualization tools of no-code software while enabling more sophisticated data processing capabilities.
The output data can also be used as input for developing custom algorithms, including the integration of machine learning models and artificial intelligence. This step enables a wide range of applications, such as urban feature prediction, classification or segmentation of remote sensing data, and clustering of spatial data.
Adopting a hybrid approach significantly enhances an organization's analytical capabilities. These advanced analyses provide deeper insights into spatial patterns and trends that manual methods alone may not reveal.
The hands-on example, based on census data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), demonstrates geospatial data processing with Python and the GeoPandas library, both open-source solutions. This example will include the use of Python in geospatial data processing through the following steps: data extraction, data processing, and customized algorithm application.
In conclusion, integrating Python into these workflows enhances flexibility and analytical capabilities, allowing organizations to innovate in their solutions and create new opportunities for products and services. Coding elevates data-driven decision-making and enables more sophisticated and scalable analyses, particularly when dealing with large and complex datasets. This case study serves as an inspiring example for organizations and researchers aiming to maximize the potential of their geospatial data, highlighting the significant benefits of combining traditional geospatial software with powerful open-source tools.

                <abstract>The purpose of this work is to show the benefits and difficulties of using scripts, whether in Python or SQL.
The work is the result of the author's experience in developing sophisticated Python scripts to build a thematic model for the heat spot data from the “BD Queimada program” of Brazil's National Institute for Space Research.
The thematic model consists of generating tables in the database (Postgres) that represent the themes with the heat spot data. The themes are represented by area of interest, such as Conservation Units, Indigenous Lands, Settlements, Biomes, ...
The aim of the work was to import the heat spot data and generate aggregated tables with themes in an automated way, making it easy to add new themes.
After the script went into production, it was necessary to add another theme, and although I made an effort in the script to make it easy to add a new theme, things didn't work out the way I wanted them to.
By writing the script in SQL, and putting it into production, the author can observe the details of when we should use Python or SQL to automate the thematic model with hotspots.
The script is being used to help monitor forest fires in the main areas of operation of The National Center to Prevent and Combat Forest fires.</abstract>

                <abstract>My journey from field biologist to GRASS GIS board member exemplifies the accessibility of open source contributions. Curiosity and a willingness to learn propelled me into the world of geospatial analysis, leading to a deep appreciation for the power of open source tools and community. I had the chance to witness firsthand the transformative power of open collaboration and this was really inspiring and engaging. However, I also recognized the need to bridge the gap between the global open source community and regions such as Latin America.
 
In this keynote, I will explore and reflect on strategies for breaking down barriers and fostering a more inclusive open source community, emphasizing the importance of mentorship, education, and accessible resources. By drawing on my personal experiences and lessons learned, I aim to inspire and empower attendees to become active contributors and leaders to build a more sustainable open source ecosystem!</abstract>

                <abstract>Community standards are specifications that are created through informal organization and are then widely adopted by a larger group. The STAC specification and Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs are examples of community specifications that have become de facto standards for geospatial interoperability. This talk will examine how the process of developing community standards differs from traditional standards development and how to drive adoption. Numerous examples of successful community standards will be presented.

In addition, we will provide a case study of a current effort - that of STAPI - a specification for satellite tasking, or more specifically, an API for how users can order data from the future from satellite platforms. We have been spearheading an effort to develop such a specification and after two sprints we presented at the last FOSS4G in Kosovo.  This prompted a third sprint in Europe, bringing together an even larger community.  Working with government groups, commercial satellite operators, and data integrators, these sprints have worked toward developing a specification as well as implementations for several commercial providers, as well as ordering APIs for public datasets.

This talk will dive into what worked for STAC and other community standards and how we are taking those lessons to develop a standardized way for collecting future geospatial data.</abstract>

                <abstract>IDE-Sisema regulated by Joint Resolution Semad/Feam/IEF/Igam No. 2,466 of February 13, 2017, updated by No. 3,147/2022, is managed by a committee composed of members with expertise in geotechnologies and IT. This committee is responsible for defining standards, managing data integrity and quality, providing geospatial data, and offering technical support to Sisema units.

Five Fundamental Pillars for Implementation
The implementation and management of IDE-Sisema are based on five fundamental pillars:

Data
Sisema's geospatial data are structured according to the Technical Specifications for Structuring Vector Geospatial Data (ET-EDGV) and IBGE quality standards. Joint Resolution 3,147/2022 specifies that digital files must be delivered in vector format, ensuring data compatibility and topological validation.

Norms and Standards
Aligned with the Implementation Plans of INDE and IEDE-MG, IDE-Sisema adopts technical and institutional standards such as Manual 01 of Structuring Norms and Naming Standards. These standards ensure data, metadata, and data dictionaries consistency, following the Brazilian Geospatial Metadata Profile (MGB).

Technologies
The choice of free and open-source technologies was motivated by consolidated experiences like IDEA-SP and INDE, aiming to ensure cyclical evolution and resource savings. The infrastructure uses PostgreSQL for data storage, GeoServer for hosting and layer interoperability, PHP, React, and Leaflet for the geovisualization platform, and GeoNetwork for metadata management.

Policies
Policies establish guidelines for data production, storage, and dissemination, ensuring adherence to established standards and process efficiency. These policies are implemented through resolutions and manuals that regulate IDE-Sisema's functioning.

Governance and People
Governance is decentralized and intersectoral, with the Steering Committee coordinating activities and ensuring the participation of all stakeholders. This model ensures that decisions are made collaboratively and that all Sisema entities are aligned.

Technologies Implemented in IDE-Sisema

1. Database Management System - DBMS (PostgreSQL):
PostgreSQL is used for structuring and storing geospatial data, allowing spatial queries and logical operations through SQL language. It also offers full ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) support, ensuring the efficiency of transactions and requests. The integration with the spatial variable through the PostGIS extension provides complete adherence of the solution to IDE-Sisema's needs, ensuring the structuring and storage of geospatial data in its environment, as well as its use in GIS software like QGIS. Responsiveness with other programming languages like Python also provided scalability for implementing automations when dealing with large volumes of data to be stored and/or transacted.

2. Map Server (GeoServer):
Hosting and replicating the structured data in the DBMS in a web environment is done via GeoServer, a Java-based application that consolidates resources for geospatial data dissemination, ensuring layer interoperability through WMS, WFS, and WCS protocols, allowing layer transactions hosted in applications that support geospatial data visualization and processing. GeoServer ensures layer replication on the infrastructure's WebGIS platform and enables data usage in GIS such as QGIS, providing data transactions in applications that consume and process spatial data. Given the magnitude of IDE-Sisema and the increasing data flow and consumption, it was also possible to implement a clustered server environment with a master instance transacting hosted information among clone instances through Docker Kubernetes containerized environment, ensuring operation scalability.

3. Geographic Visualization Platform (WebGIS):
Developed using PHP, Next.Js, and Turf.Js with resources based on the Leaflet library, the WebGIS platform offers an interactive interface for consulting, manipulating, and visually analyzing layers. The newly delivered version 3.0 of the viewer encompassed basic functionalities of filtering, overlaying, and spatial analysis to expand the set of resources and layer interpretation.

4. Geospatial Metadata Catalog (GeoNetwork):
For structuring and publishing geospatial metadata layers, a GeoNetwork-based server was implemented, enhancing the interoperability standards brought by GeoServer through the CSW protocol. The metadata implemented based on ISO 19139:2007 and 19115-3:2018 standards and in .xml format maintain the levels of completeness and consistency of traceability and layer cataloging information common to the OGC standard and the Brazilian Geospatial Metadata Profile (MGB) developed by IBGE.

5. Web Service
Developed in OpenAPI, it performs queries and returns spatial analysis of layers hosted on the GeoServer server via GeoJSON format.

The first use case of the Web Service is the automation of locational criteria consultation and restriction or prohibition factors for licensing processes through the Preset module, where requests based on spatial predicates such as overlap are made to the Web Service, returning them to the module, automating the process of framing and restriction.

Challenges and Future Perspectives
Expansion of sectoral capillarity, increment of new technological solutions, and promotion of training. Adoption and improvement of automated processes and expansion of functionalities offered by the infrastructure. Future perspectives include:

Revising the standard metadata template currently adopted to rationalize the summarization used and contemplate the hall of requirements of the INSPIRE directive;

Adopting ETL-based tools to automate and rationalize processes related to IDE-Sisema management as well as geotechnology solutions in general.

Conclusions
IDE-Sisema has established itself as an essential tool for environmental management in Minas Gerais, promoting the structuring, organization, and dissemination of geospatial data. The decentralized management model and the adoption of free technologies ensure the continuous evolution of the infrastructure, contributing to the efficiency of public policies and information transparency.</abstract>

                <abstract>The development community is really excited about having modern (REST and JSON) protocols for geospatial data infrastructure. While we love the traditional WMS and WFS protocols, the heavy use of XML is a barrier to today’s developers and tool chains.

GeoServer is enthusiastically pursuing these standards thanks to the efforts of Andrea Aime and other volunteers at the joint OSGeo / OGC code sprints. The GeoNetwork team has also attended these events to work on record management.

* This presentation looks at the approach used by the OGCAPI family of protocols.
* We also look at how OGCAPI Features works in more detail, as one of the first standards to be finalized.
* We check in with OGCAPI Records and the progress made by the GeoNetwork team
* We look at the OGCAPI standardization process, and what features we are looking forward to being finalized
* Looking ahead to what is needed for OGCAPI support in GeoServer to be successful

Jody and Gabe are enthusiastic GeoServer developers really using this presentation as an excuse to work on these new protocols.

Attend this talk to learn about the transition to OGCAPI Protocols and help your organisation plan for the future.</abstract>

                <abstract>Wow it has been a busy year for security vulnerabilities. While FOSS4G software is unlikely to result in global “blue screen of death” outages - we are getting caught up in the general push to regulate IT and impose “security” on the technology that powers society.

This talk unpacks what this can look like for foss4g projects using real world examples. 

* Built around the experience of the GeoServer project, and the resulting security policy and practices that can serve as a template for our foss4g community.
* Public institutions can attend this talk to learn how their security policies interact with and affect foss4g technologies.
* Vendors and service providers can learn how open source supply chains affect their products.
* FOSS4G projects can attend to learn how to approach security reports with compassion, and a bit of boundary setting, to take care of your codebase and community.

This talk explores the tensions, expectations, terrors and triumphs on this hot button topic.</abstract>

                <abstract>The ever-increasing volume of geospatial data presents challenges in discovery, access, and utilization. The Spatio-Temporal Asset Catalog (STAC) standard offers a standardized approach to describing and accessing spatiotemporal assets. This talk explores the integration of STAC with QGIS.
We describe the benefits of STAC integration, including improved data discoverability through user-friendly search functionalities, streamlined access to remote data sources, and potential for automation in data download and processing workflows within QGIS.
The talk outlines the technical approach for integrating STAC, which involve developing a new servevice provider within core QGIS. We discuss potential challenges, such as ensuring compatibility with various STAC implementations and data providers.
Finally, the talk highlights the potential impact of STAC integration. By leveraging the STAC ecosystem, QGIS users can benefit from a wider range of geospatial data resources, enhancing their ability to conduct spatial analysis and create insightful maps.</abstract>

                <abstract>FAIR principles are a set of best practices aimed at making data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable to both humans and machines. The growth of spatial data infrastructures and discovery catalogs (aka ‘geoportals’) have highlighted the importance of geospatial data management, metadata, and systems architecture. These data are invaluable to public, private, and academic sectors for use in decision-making, policy development, research, as well as subsequent data production. However, the costs and overall effort associated with the curation of data throughout their lifecycle can be substantial. The Stanford Spatial Data Infrastructure implements FAIR principles to its collections of geospatial data in order to better meet the needs of its researchers and worldwide user community. These principles are applied to data, metadata, and infrastructure, and serve as a guide for collecting, organizing, and managing data that are produced through research endeavors, published by public entities for open consumption, or created by vendors for commercial purposes.

In this presentation, the design and implementation of a geospatial data curation strategy utilizing FAIR principles will be described. Additionally. we will discuss our efforts around automation in data wrangling and metadata, as well as access, licensing, and digital preservation.</abstract>

                <abstract>[Shortbread](https://shortbread-tiles.org/) is an open schema for OSM vector tiles. It is intended to be a basic, lean, general-purpose vector tile schema for OpenStreetMap data.

For creating and extending OSM vector tiles, workflows using [Tilemaker](https://tilemaker.org/), [Planetiler](https://github.com/onthegomap/planetiler) and [osm2pgsql Themepark](https://osm2pgsql.org/themepark/) are compared.

Since vector tiles are styled in the browser, the styling can be changed at runtime. This talk shows the tooling for customizing styles, but also goes into extending vector tile content with additional data for special interests.</abstract>

                <abstract>**DigiAgriApp** is an free and open-source client-server application designed to manage a wide variety of data. This data can be collected either manually or directly from sensors. 
The application is composed  of various open-source components such as PostgreSQL/PostGIS and  Django for the back-end, Flutter for the front-end, and a plugin for QGIS to manage geometries. 
Over the past year, since its first presentation in Kosovo, DigiAgriApp has undergone many improvements and gained new features. Users can now save data from measurements and observations made in the field. Moreover, a new component has been added to manage production data, particularly data collected by sorting machine, allowing the possibility to perform some simple analysis. Other improvements on the  client-side include the possibility of assigning different aspects (such as death, an observation or measurement) to one or more plants. The QGIS plugin allows to manage the geographical components of the database, primarily fields, subfields, rows and plants. The latest innovation is the integration of artificial intelligence, thanks to a new project funded by the Fondazione Valorizzazione della Ricerca Trentina. Specifically machine vision algorithms have been incorporated to analyze images and provide extrapolated values. The first application of the model is able to recognize the presence of Scaphoideus Titanus, a vector responsible for spreading the Flavescence dorée disease, which poses a potential threat to vineyards, on a pheromone photochromic trap.
During our presentation we will showcase the first adoption of the application within FEM covering about 15 hectares and more than 20000 plants to demonstrate the application’s functionalities.</abstract>

                <abstract>Forest ecology research often requires detailed forest inventory data at the individual tree level, but such data are time-consuming and costly to collect using traditional ground-based manual survey methods. Recent advances in uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs, or drones), image processing, and deep learning are enabling a new era of forest research in which individual trees can be mapped, measured, and taxonomically identified across broad areas without extensive ground surveys. The Open Forest Observatory (OFO; openforestobservatory.org) is a new multi-institution organization that makes cutting-edge forest mapping tools and data accessible to ecologists and practitioners without extensive specialized computing background. Open-source OFO tools simplify and automate tasks including: (a) processing drone imagery into 3D canopy models and stitched imagery mosaics, (b) performing individual tree detection, geospatial crown delineation, and height measurement from drone-derived canopy height models, and (c) obtaining taxonomic classification of detected trees from raw drone images (including multiple views of each tree) using deep learning and 3D geometric reasoning. The OFO also hosts an extensive public database of raw and processed drone imagery from western U.S. forests (&gt; 35 km2) across broad gradients in forest structure, species composition, and disturbance history, and &gt; 100 field-based individual tree maps used for developing and validating the drone-based mapping tools. The growing database is available to host community-contributed datasets from forests globally. In relatively challenging (dense and structurally complex mixed-conifer forest conditions, current OFO overstory tree detection algorithms achieve precision and recall of 70-90%, and current tree height estimation achieves R2 of 0.95. In a challenging cross-site task, preliminary tree species classification using OFO multi-view computer vision tools achieved 76% accuracy across five species, compared with 54% accuracy of a baseline using a single top-down view from a stitched imagery mosaic. All tools and data are free for use by anyone to address ecology questions or build on the tools, and the OFO welcomes collaborations and contributions to data and code. Some current development priorities include (a) expanding multi-view mapping tools to support tree detection using computer vision, (b) optimizing tree detection and species classification algorithms across broad gradients of forest structure and species composition, and (c) developing cloud-native workflows for automated cataloging and processing of contributed drone-based and field-based forest data.</abstract>

                <abstract>The summer of 2024 saw extreme floods and landslides in Switzerland, significantly affecting the Ticino, Grisons and Valais regions.
This talk examines the critical role of QField's new plugin framework in complementing the aerial rapid mapping effort with crowdsourced oblique (terrestrial) imagery. We will discuss a quickly built proof-of-concept (POC) project that used QField's new customizable plugins, allowing first responders, civil protection agencies, and citizens to map and report damages efficiently. The session will introduce the plugin framework, its easy deployment through QFieldCloud, and its possible impact on field data collection workflows in enterprise and community settings.</abstract>

                <title>State of PgHydro - Hydrographic Extension for PostgreSQL/PostGIS</title>

                <abstract>The PostgreSQL extension for Hydrographic Applications Project (PgHydro) represents the first innovation of intelligence as an extension of spatial database management systems for use in water resources management that uses the sub-catchment network model and the logic elements present in the Pfafstetter basin coding system. PgHydro aims for an add-on implementation of a spatial database management system performed by a series of tables, queries, functions, or views that can be used individually to assist in water resources decision-making. These objects are the hydrography core of the intelligence system developed using free open-source software that can be used by anyone dealing with water resources management. To this end, this new conceptual model was implemented in the object-relational spatial database management system PostgreSQL/PostGIS, respecting the integrity constraints related to the geometry of the mapped objects. These user-defined constraints respect the logical objects based on the Pfafstetter basin coding system and integrity constraints linked to the spatial relationships between objects, which follow the ISO SQL/MM specifications. The main advantage of using the pghydro extension is the possibility to process large datasets and complex queries using a simpler hydrography model and the tools and languages already available in spatial database management systems that work as a framework for the future development of new extensions related to water resources.
The pghydro functionalities can be run using a GUI developed in a QGIS plugin called PgHydro Tools. After the physical implementation of the pgHydro Scheme in the spatial database management system, the construction of the Pfafsteter hydrography dataset is started using the hydrography objects that make up the pgHydro Tools. The construction of this base is divided into seven stages: 1) Creation of the spatial database and creation of the pghydro extension; 2) insertion of the drainage lines and the drainage areas in the spatial database; 3) verification of the consistency of the drainage network geometries and topologies; 4) verification of the consistency of the drainage areas geometries and topologies; 5) verification of the consistency of topology between the drainage network and the drainage areas; 6) Pfafstetter basin coding and other information, finally; 7) export of the final Pfafstetter hydrography dataset. Optional steps are the systematization of river names and the management of the multiuser edition.
Last year, the pgh_raster was developed, which allows the insertion of the digital elevation model and products derived from it, such as drainage direction and flow accumulation. Functions allow retrieving the downstream or upstream pixel given a position as well as the elevation profile along a given specific geometry.
Another extension developed for pghydro was the pgh_hgm, a hydrogeomorphometric extension used to calculate information such as minimum and maximum elevation, slope, concentration time, time travel, and others related to drainage geometry and digital elevation. The pghydro project is officially and widely used by the National Water and Sanitation Agency of Brazil as a reference for the Brazilian Water Resources Management.</abstract>

                <abstract>Collecting data in the field has become an essential task in most geospatial workflows. Geospatial data collection using mobile applications is expensive because it involves human effort, and several considerations need to be taken into account. Geospatial professionals should ensure high-quality data so that the capital effort employed yields reliable results, as collected data often represents an input for downstream processes. 

This talk will share practical insights and experiences from a fieldwork project conducted in Mozambique for agricultural applications using QField and QField Cloud. It will illustrate from practical examples how to effectively set up forms, capture EXIF information from photos, and navigate the constraints encountered during fieldwork. The presentation will provide user-level tips and tricks to maximize the potential of these powerful tools for geospatial data collection and management.

The talk will also summarize the most important lessons learned from a recent experience in Mozambique by describing common issues encountered during fieldwork in remote areas,  solutions or workarounds for overcoming these challenges, and some recommendations for fieldwork data collection design. The showcase focuses on agriculture; however, practical examples apply to any tool that uses QGIS forms.</abstract>

                <abstract>GeoParquet (https://geoparquet.org/) is a cloud-native format created to address the geospatial interoperability issues between data warehouses. It is based on the widely supported columnar storage Apache Parquet (https://parquet.apache.org/), extending it to add support for geometry data types (e.g.: points, lines and polygons). Although a relatively recent format, it already has a good ecosystem of tools, and it took Standardisation very seriously by joining the path to become an OGC Standard (https://github.com/opengeospatial/geoparquet).

The eMOTIONAL Cities project (https://emotionalcities-h2020.eu/) aims to understand how the natural and built environment can shape the feelings and emotions of those who experience it. At its core, lies a Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI), which combines a variety of datasets from the Urban Health domain (https://emotional.byteroad.net/). These datasets should be available to urban planners, neuroscientists and other stakeholders, for analysis, creating data products and eventually making decisions based upon them. To support an efficient analysis, especially of the larger datasets, we have decided to offer GeoParquet as an alternate encoding. In this talk we share our experience, converting and publishing the +90 datasets of the eMOTIONAL Cities SDI using a stack of FOSS/OSGeo software (GDAL, gpq, pygeoapi).

We will show that there is already a set of (FOSS) tools in place (e.g.: readers, writers, validators) to support this task and to encourage others to add a Standards-based cloud-native format to their SDIs.</abstract>

                <abstract>Ever since the year 25,000 B.C.E, when the first known map was carved into a Mammoth tusk, map makers have relied on geometric symbols derived from nature in order to represent a geography. However, even though modern digital cartography brings about endless possibilities for map customization and visualization, the art of utilizing geometric symbols in maps has been all but forgotten in the era of modern map design.

In order to resurrect, appreciate, and preserve the art form of geometric patterns derived from nature, and to incorporate them in a nuanced form within modern digital cartography, we present Mapajoara: a self-contained free and open source interactive map of Belém integrating indigenous Marajoara iconography into the underlying map interface, using ancient drawing patterns to represent different geographic and urban elements.

Each Marajoara pattern appearing on the map has been studied and carefully selected to symbolize rivers, forests, urbanized areas, and other significant aspects of Belém, offering a visually distinct and culturally enriching experience to users. Our project not only highlights the beauty and importance of Marajoara art, but also promotes interaction and learning about the geography and culture of the region through a modern and accessible technological platform.</abstract>

                <abstract>This presentation shows how QGIS, OpenStreetMap, and other open resources were used to reconstruct narrative maps conveying one woman’s experience with space and identity in mid-20th-century São Paulo. In 1960, the edited diary of Carolina Maria de Jesus, Quarto de Despejo, become one of the best-selling books in Brazil. It vividly portrayed the struggles of a single mother scavenging the streets of the city looking for anything to sell so she could feed her family. Some Brazilians did not believe that a Black woman from a “favela” neighborhood could have composed such a poetically poignant manuscript, but more recent scholarship has confirmed the authenticity of Carolina’s authorship.  

It is clear that Carolina saw and felt lines of division between her neighborhood and the city not visible on any printed maps of the time. When going into “the city” she felt like she was in paradise, or a beautiful guest room; whereas her neighborhood on the precarious margins of the Tietê River was viewed as the backyard trash heap, subject to environmental hazards and government neglect. In this talk, I use narrative maps to show how these different places in Carolina’s life were constructed and what they each meant to her.  

In order to better understand Carolina's relationship to the spaces she called “the favela” and “the city”, I carefully constructed a list of every place mentioned in Quarto de Despejo. Employing a combination of archival research, Internet searches, onsite visits, and modern GIS databases, our research team located and mapped as many of these locations as possible, using QGIS software. For a base layer, we fashioned a historical street grid by starting with OpenStreetMap and modifying the geometries to conform to old aerial photographs freely available online. We then used our newly-created databases to compose narrative maps of Carolina’s São Paulo, focusing on areas where she did and did not go, as well as places where she experienced different kinds of emotions, challenges, access to resources, and interactions with the state. These maps demonstrate how geographic and social barriers both seen and unseen influenced the daily lives of Paulistanos in the 1950s, a challenge that persists in Brazil today.</abstract>

                <abstract>This talk explores how the Brazilian Federal Police leverages FOSS4G to integrate and visualize data from Brasil MAIS, a multi-million dollar environmental monitoring program, using our custom-built Inteligeo platform.

Brasil MAIS monitors over 2.9 million km² weekly - about 34% of Brazil's vast 8.5 million km² territory. To manage the resulting massive amounts of satellite imagery and environmental change alerts, we developed Inteligeo, a GeoNode-based solution currently in production at the Federal Police and in various stages of adoption across multiple government agencies.

We'll discuss:
1. Building Inteligeo on FOSS4G principles (GeoNode, PostGIS, GDAL, GeoServer, FastAPI) to enable seamless data integration across government agencies.
2. Implementing user-friendly tools for non-specialists and integrating with Gov.br authentication.
3. Using FastAPI for complex integrations, such as streamlining access to the XYZ data provider for Brasil Mais.
4. Technical challenges in scaling Brasil MAIS to handle 46 million monthly tile views and serve 500+ public institutions and 100,000+ users.
5. The crucial sponsorship of the Ministry of Management and Innovation in Public Services (MGI) in developing Inteligeo 5 since 2021, and their plans for its independent use.

Brasil MAIS has already demonstrated significant impact, contributing to over R$16 billion ($2.8 billion USD) in environmental crime-related fines and asset freezes. While Inteligeo is still ramping up adoption, it aims to compound this impact by enhancing the efficiency of data utilization. We anticipate measuring Inteligeo-specific results in the coming year, showcasing how FOSS4G solutions can amplify the effectiveness of large-scale environmental monitoring programs.

We'll conclude by examining how this integration serves as a model for similar global initiatives in environmental management and welcome input from the FOSS4G community on further improvements.</abstract>

                <title>Rendering OGC API Compliant Vector Tiles on the Fly with pygeoapi + Elasticsearch</title>
                <subtitle />
                <type>Talk</type>

                <abstract>Tiled maps are well-known for their performance and have been present in web map applications for more than twenty years. Vector tiles combine all the benefits of map tiling with the ability to access attributes, enabling client side attribute-based rendering. This makes them one of the most efficient ways of visualising vector data, and they are present in many interactive web maps that we see on the web today.

However the proliferation of web map applications has often resulted in a lack of interoperability between tile servers and clients. This was the motivation for the OGC API - Tiles Standard (https://tiles.developer.ogc.org/), published in late 2022. The core of this Standard is very simple, adding some formality to what people have been doing for years with XYZ tilesets, while specifying some metadata elements that help clients do a better job at creating maps (e.g.: title, description, zoom levels, custom projection). 

In this talk we will present a software stack to render OGC compliant vector tiles. This stack includes pygeoapi (https://pygeoapi.io/), an OSGeo project and a Reference Implementation for OGC API - Tiles (https://www.ogc.org/resources/product-details/?pid=1663). The architecture of pygeoapi supports backend plugins, which use different software for storing and accessing geospatial data. For the purpose of creating vector tiles, we will present the MVT-elastic plugin (https://github.com/geopython/pygeoapi/blob/master/pygeoapi/provider/mvt_elastic.py), which leverages the Elasticsearch capability of rendering vector tiles on the fly, from geospatial data stored in an Elasticsearch index. Elasticsearch (https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch) is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine. Recently, this plugin also became capable of exposing the attributes associated with the data, enabling client side styling of attributes. These capabilities can be demonstrated by creating a Leaflet map that consumes and styles the pygeoapi+elastic vector tiles (https://emotional-cities.github.io/vtiles-example/demo-oat.htm). 

We hope that this presentation can make the creation of fast, expressive and interoperable maps, accessible to anyone.</abstract>

                <title>Wagtail CMS + pygeoapi = Modern SDI for the current needs</title>

                <abstract>The current state of the art of Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs) is limited to solutions that are already becoming stagnant in terms of their approach and technology.

Today, we need more robust and modern SDIs, beyond the logic of flat data tables with a spatial component, with data access that is either all open or all closed, lacking granularity.
Wagtail is originally used as a content management system, I propose a modern SDI where data management can be granular, with access roles and version control.

Thanks to the pygeoapi library, this application also allows the publication of modern REST web services, according to OGC API specifications.

The premise of this proposal is to have a platform with extensive features, but also with current and modern standards, and as simple as possible, without the need to integrate multiple platforms and synchronization agents, etc.

Basically, this is a simple Django, but enhanced for the management and publication of spatial data with a modern and scalable approach.

Wagtail is well known for content management but its use for spatial data management has not been explored until now. On the other hand, pygeoapi is an agnostic library but primarily intended only for publication, not for data management, even less for data that changes day by day.

For ending this proposal precisely resolves both the granular and versioned management of spatial data as well as their publication according to the new OGC (OGC API) standards.</abstract>

                <title>Leveraging Geospatial Street Data for Effective Urban Mobility Policies: A Comprehensive Methodology for Road Safety Analysis in Brazilian Cities Through Geoprocessing</title>
                <subtitle />
                <type>Talk</type>

                <abstract>Cities can be characterized as an extremely complex and dynamic environment, which integrates multiple interdependent factors and presents a significant challenge in the development and monitoring of public policies. To deal with this complexity and ensure truly effective policies, data-driven decision-making is essential. Cities produce a large volume of data that is crucial for informing these policies. However, many cities face significant challenges in collecting and analyzing quality data due to a lack of technical and human resources. Furthermore, while tabular data is important, it often fails to capture the complex contextual layers present in the urban territory. Geospatial information provides a deeper and more contextualized understanding of the urban context, enriching the decision-making process and promoting more effective public policies.
Within the complexity of city management, safe and sustainable mobility increasingly stands out as an area demanding special attention, primarily due to the challenge of addressing the issue of premature road traffic deaths and injuries. The World Health Organization (WHO) indicates that more than 1.19 million people die in traffic worldwide every year — in Brazil, there are over 30,000 annual victims.
The Safe System and Vision Zero Approach, which advocate that no death or serious injury in traffic is acceptable, illustrate the complexity of urban mobility. The concept involves several areas of action that must be worked on in an integrated manner, including safe road infrastructure and urban design. Therefore, understanding all layers of the territory is essential for identifying risk areas, planning effective interventions, and monitoring results, ensuring that mobility contributes to building a safer urban environment.
The complexity of cities and the need to deeply understand the various aspects that comprise them make territorial analysis an indispensable component in the data and evidence-based decision-making process. By collecting and using data to identify critical areas, for example, it is possible to effectively propose road safety actions and public policies aligned with the Safe Systems approach. For this reason, the Cordial Institute sought to create a methodology for interpreting the territory to facilitate road safety analyses and offer valuable data-based information. This way, it is possible to directly assist municipalities in developing public policies that promote safer mobility in Brazilian cities.
This methodology, named ‘Structurals’, assumes that the road system is not uniform but divided between intersections and mid-blocks (structurals), each having different interactions in the urban environment. Road intersections, for example, are areas of many encounters between different road users, which can sometimes lead to conflicting situations. These conflicts can result in traffic incidents and, therefore, this dynamic deserves significant attention. On the other hand, mid-blocks have different behaviors, such as increased vehicle acceleration or pedestrians crossing outside designated areas, so it is also important in analyses in a complementary way to intersections’.
The processing of structurals requires a few spatial databases that are commonly developed by municipalities: road blocks, central median/divider (if the road block base does not contain this information), and road axis. With this, it is possible to generate a tool with significant analytical impact using easily processed data from municipalities.
To georeference this dynamic, it is necessary to trace the road axis to identify where they meet (intersections) and where they are continuous (mid-blocks). Using PostGIS, the geospatial data extension of PostgreSQL, both free and open-source, a geospatial processing is performed where perpendicular lines to the roadblock polygons are drawn, meeting at an equivalent geometric distance point. Lines are drawn every meter along the roadblock face, resulting in several points located at the road's central axis. These points are connected by lines forming the road axes. When they intersect, they are identified as a road intersection.
From the geoprocessing, intersection areas are drawn in an open-source Geographic Information System (GIS) program, QGis. These areas are ‘buffers’ created from the points generated by the geometric operations, and have their design adapted if they intersect, not being limited only to the geometric point created by the axis crossing — it is not a simple buffer around each crossing but is dissolved to adapt to the road's morphology. This process identifies a primary characteristic of the road system intersections that can be included in territorial analyses: the intersection profile, or how many approaches each intersection has, making it more or less complex proportional to the number of approaches.
Once the areas considered intersections are established, the street axes not present in this area are extracted and become mid-blocks. In other words, mid-blocks are defined after the intersections' geometric definition, as their geometric opposite.
From the structurals' design, it is possible to pair with all available geographic territorial information. The more data provided by municipalities, the greater the territory's knowledge and the possibility of relating these variables. Each structural has characteristics that make more sense to be deepened. In intersections, traffic lights, bus or cycling infrastructure, road hierarchies, and pedestrian crossings can be paired. In mid-blocks, the road width, road hierarchy, speed limit, electronic surveillance presence, speed reducers, block face length, etc., can be paired.
Pairing information with structurals helps identify profiles of these spaces and create insights into road crashes in Brazilian municipalities. With this pairing, it is possible to analyze the distribution of road events between intersections or mid-blocks and their characteristics, the severity of occurrences, and identify critical points that should be prioritized in public policies. Additionally, it is an essential tool for effectiveness analyses and creating comparison groups for monitoring interventions. For example, with intersection structurals, it was possible to identify crossings with similar characteristics in São Paulo to evaluate whether those that received the "Frente Segura" intervention had a reduction in traffic incidents. The same was done with the "Melhor Uso do Leito Viário (MULV)" interventions carried out in mid-blocks of the city. These and other uses of the structurals can be seen on the publication page of the Brazilian Mobility Panel, from the Cordial Institute.</abstract>

                <abstract>The Geological Survey of Brazil (SGB) is under a digital transformation process. One of the pillars of this process involves speed, scalability, security and availability of data produced. Furthermore, CPRM is creating a favorable environment for the adoption of cloud-based architecture.

This paper aims to present an overview of a new developed Geological Spatial Data Infrastructure for the SGB. The GeoSGB is the main source for internal mapping, infographic and dashboard applications. It will assimilate legacy services, that runs on isolated map servers, such as self hosted node of OneGeology OGC Services.

The solution adopted is GeoNode 4.2, which brings together map, data services, metadata catalog and spatial database. It is free and open source software with a very active community. In addition, GeoNode has a good content management system, a rich API, and it’s fully customizable. To meet data access demands, it was customized to run in Kubernetes-based environments and each mapped area produces its own geoservice, exportable to different formats, such as shapefile and geotiff.

However, it became necessary a complete separation between the production and publishing environments. SGB’s production pipeline is composed by internally developed data management software. Some of these systems are being modernized, with updates on business rules, frameworks and security. GIS work is carried out in ArcGIS Enterprise®, with some exceptions in QGIS and GeoServer. With this background, it should be considered as a hybrid GIS model.

About database structures, a process of harmonization was necessary, mainly those produced from proprietary GIS. For legacy reasons, the proprietary structures were maintained, as long as possible to export to OGC WKT or WKB. Exported geometries are analyzed for compliance with Simple Features Standard (OGC/ISO19125). The information eligible for publication were consolidated in database views and is literally replicated to GeoSGB, by script.


The metadata production for continuous databases is carried out semi-automatically – templated - in accordance with the mapping program. This is possible by integrating GeoNode's APIs with internal databases, delivering associated metadata and resources directly to the authors. The contact with (meta)data authors were managed by GeoNode.

The symbolization of thematic layers involved the development of interoperable libraries, based on SVG glyphs inserted in OpenType fonts (ISO/IEC 14496-22:2007), with near equal rendering among different multi-platform GIS software.

Data and metadata pipelines were implemented using Python scripts, with specific libraries associated with GeoNode APIs. Apache Airflow manages the entire process of extracting internal bases, quality tests, structure analysis and loading on the GeoSGB database server, including being responsible for notification activities.

So, GeoSGB now is a continuous development platform, with focus in increase quality in delivered data to customers.

The future perspectives involve the transformation itself into research line in geotechnologies and high-performance IT services. It shoud envolve plug-in development for data management, processing and visualization including use of artificial intelligence. In operational terms, adoption of OGC APIs, data internationalization and harmonization, associated with adoption of OGC specific standards, such as GeoSciML and WaterML contributes to become SGB a global supplier of geoscientific data.</abstract>

                <abstract>This talk presents case studies of deploying GeoNode, an open-source geospatial content management system, in production environments within two Brazilian government agencies: the Geological Survey of Brazil (SGB) and the Brazilian Federal Police (PF). We'll explore how these agencies have successfully implemented and customized GeoNode to meet their specific needs, addressing common challenges in large-scale FOSS4G deployments.

Key points we'll cover:

1. SGB's approach:
   - Developing a Helm chart for automated GeoNode 4 installation on Red Hat OpenShift
   - Addressing security requirements like rootless execution and random UID support
   - Implementing autoscaling for most components based on CPU and memory utilization
   - Exploring cluster implementation of GeoServer for improved scalability

2. PF's customizations:
   - Creating a dedicated "inteligeo-deploy" repository for enhanced deployment features
   - Implementing centralized configuration and logging
   - Improving security by separating credentials and using Podman instead of Docker
   - Integrating with internal systems and scheduling data updates

We'll discuss the challenges faced, solutions implemented, and lessons learned from both approaches. These case studies demonstrate that FOSS4G solutions like GeoNode are ready for production use in government agencies, providing flexibility, scalability, and security.

By sharing our experiences, we aim to help other organizations successfully deploy GeoNode and other FOSS4G solutions in production environments. We welcome questions and discussions on best practices for large-scale FOSS4G implementations.</abstract>

                <abstract>pygeometa provides a lightweight and Pythonic approach for users to easily create geospatial metadata in standards-based formats using simple configuration files (affectionately called metadata control files [MCF]). Leveraging the simple but powerful YAML format, pygeometa can generate metadata in numerous standards. Users can also create their own custom metadata formats which can be plugged into pygeometa for custom metadata format output.

For developers, pygeometa provides a Pythonic API that allows developers to tightly couple metadata generation within their systems and integrate nicely into metadata production pipelines.

The project supports various metadata formats out of the box including ISO 19115, the WMO Core Metadata Profile, and the WIGOS Metadata Standard.

pygeometa has minimal dependencies (install is less than 50 kB), and provides a flexible extension mechanism leveraging the Jinja2 templating system.

This presentation will provide an update on recent enhancements, use in high profile projects as well as future plans and roadmap.</abstract>

                <title>Mapping Locally, Globally: A YouthMappers Perspective on Open Mapping</title>

                <abstract>Since 2015, thousands of university students across the world have joined the YouthMappers network, creating and using open geospatial data to address local and global development challenges. At over 410 universities in 78 countries—including 60 chapters in 18 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean—student-led YouthMappers chapters leverage free, open-source geospatial tools to map their communities and priority regions. This presentation explores the confluence of factors that have enabled university youth spanning diverse identities, academic backgrounds, and languages to successfully engage in YouthMappers activities and with the broader open mapping community. The presentation also discusses the challenges that YouthMappers students face in applying open mapping methods and tools to their work. It features the lived experiences of YouthMappers students, particularly in the Latin American context, and foregrounds topics of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility.

YouthMappers chapters collaborate with the US Agency for International Development, humanitarian organizations like the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team, local and federal governments, NGOs, and other partners to address gaps in geospatial data. Students map areas both in person using open survey tools and remotely using satellite imagery. Ultimately, the open data that they collect and publish power development interventions, disaster response, and digital ecosystem growth, largely in low- and middle-income countries. The key to the YouthMappers network’s expansive growth and impact is its sense of community. For many students, YouthMappers is their initial introduction to open GIS software and its real-world applications. Students build their open mapping skills through peer-to-peer learning within the network and with mentorship from individuals in the larger FOSS4G ecosystem.

As a testament to the power of the network, YouthMappers students have collectively contributed over 24 million edits to OpenStreetMap since 2015. Advancements in open mapping software, such as improved options for low-connectivity environments and non-English-speaking users, have enabled YouthMappers students from a greater range of backgrounds to participate in open mapping. The YouthMappers network has also contributed to building FOSS4G tools, such as OSM Teams. This presentation highlights these successes and calls for continued mutually beneficial partnerships between YouthMappers chapters and the broader FOSS4G community.

This talk is rooted in a book chapter of the same name co-authored by the three presenters. The chapter will be published in the forthcoming open-access book Open Movements: Recognizing Challenges and Building Connections.</abstract>

                <subtitle />
                <type>Talk</type>

                <abstract>Extreme precipitation events lead to rapid surface runoff, causing sheet erosion and the formation of rills, increasing the risk of flash floods. This combination of processes pose a threat to agricultural and rural areas and the sediment-laden water can infect even the urban zones or cause damage to infrastructure. Detecting and predicting the formation of erosive rills on agricultural land is, therefore, crucial for effective land management and disaster prevention in rural areas.  

  

The contribution presents a research on the utilisation of convolutional neural networks (CNN) to detect enhanced erosion using remote sensing data combined with the SMODERP hydrological and erosion model.   

  

While most tools for semantic segmentation (such as random forests) work only with single-pixel values, CNNs consider also the relationship with its surroundings and between the bands. As the erosion rill patterns are visible especially when compared to the surrounding soil, it is a valuable feature for their detection.   

  

However, if we also have the digital elevation model, we can use geospatial tools and algorithms to enhance the imagery input to the neural networks with knowledge-based indices. In this case, it is the SMODERP model.  

  

SMODERP is a hydrological model designed to simulate surface runoff and erosion processes. It considers various factors such as soil type, land cover, slope, and rainfall intensity to predict the movement of water and sediments throughout the landscape. The model calculates the critical height of sheet runoff as a rill formation threshold, which is essential to understand where erosion is likely to occur. The SMODERP is developed as a GIS tool, available through GRASS GIS and QGIS. More details about model on smoderp.fsv.cvut.cz or on GitHub.  

  

The methodology begins with data collection and preparation, utilising high-resolution orthophoto aerial images of spatial resolutions of only a few centimetres. Additionally, hydrological data from the SMODERP model are incorporated to the CNN's input to capture erosion dynamics. The talk will discuss the effect of the SMODERP's output inclusion on the CNN's accuracy in rill detection.</abstract>

                <abstract>Open Software and Open Standards are complementary pieces of the geospatial ecosystem. In January 2022, OSGeo and OGC signed a new and updated version of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) that aims to maximize the achievement of the mission and goals of both organizations. Execution of joint Code Sprints, identifying free and open source technologies that could be used as Reference Implementations for OGC Standards and validating OGC compliance tests are examples of activities that can take place within the scope of the agreement.

In the first year after the agreement was signed, we established the basilar stones for the OSGeo membership within OGC and promoted the related activities within OSGeo. Now we start to see an increasing interest from both sides and some outcomes which are important to highlight.

This presentation will provide an overview of all activities accomplished under the MoU over the last year, as well as discuss future plans. For those who have been distracted, it will reiterate the benefits of the agreement, which allows OSGeo charter members to represent the priorities of OSGeo in the development of OGC Standards and supporting documents and services.

                <abstract>## Introduction

The ability to efficiently and accurately represent geographic data is a cornerstone of many modern applications, from navigation systems to environmental monitoring. Uber’s H3 index offers a transformative approach to handling spatial data, making it a valuable tool for developers and researchers alike. In this talk, we will explore how the H3 index can be utilized across a variety of open-source projects. We will delve into its advantages, such as ease of distance calculation, reliability at extreme latitudes, and the benefits of storing data as areas rather than points. Additionally, a live demo will illustrate the practical applications of the H3 index in real-time.

## Main Points

1. **Ease of Distance Calculation**
   
   Calculating distances between geographic points is a fundamental task in many applications. Traditional methods, relying on latitude and longitude, can be computationally intensive and complex. The H3 index simplifies this process by using a hexagonal grid system. Each hexagon, or cell, has a unique identifier that allows for straightforward distance calculations. This system reduces the computational overhead and enhances the performance of applications that require frequent distance measurements, such as ride-sharing services and delivery optimization platforms.

2. **Reliability at the Poles**

   Geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) become less reliable and more distorted as one moves towards the poles due to the curvature of the Earth. The H3 index mitigates this issue through its hexagonal grid, which maintains consistent cell shapes and sizes across the globe, including polar regions. This characteristic ensures that spatial analyses and operations are accurate and reliable, regardless of geographic location. For instance, environmental monitoring projects can benefit from this consistency when tracking climate change indicators in polar areas.

3. **Storing Data as Areas**

   Traditional spatial data storage often relies on point-based representations, which can lead to inefficiencies and inaccuracies, particularly when dealing with large datasets or areas. The H3 index allows for data to be stored as areas rather than points, leveraging its hexagonal cells. This approach offers several advantages:
   - **Efficiency:** Hexagonal cells cover areas more uniformly, reducing data redundancy and improving storage efficiency.
   - **Accuracy:** By representing regions as collections of hexagonal cells, spatial analyses can be more precise. This is especially useful for applications such as urban planning and resource management.
   - **Scalability:** Hexagonal cells can easily aggregate or disaggregate, facilitating scalable solutions for various spatial resolutions.

## Conclusion

Uber’s H3 index is a powerful tool that enhances how we handle and analyze geographic data. Its ease of distance calculation, reliability at extreme latitudes, and efficient area-based data storage present significant advantages for a wide range of open-source projects. By adopting the H3 index, developers and researchers can achieve more accurate, efficient, and scalable solutions for their spatial data needs.

During the talk, we will demonstrate these benefits with a live demo, showcasing how the H3 index can be implemented in a real-world scenario. Whether you are a developer seeking to optimize your application’s performance or a researcher aiming for precise spatial analysis, the H3 index offers a versatile and robust solution.</abstract>

                <title>Enhancing Resilience to Pluvial Flooding in Pacific Island Nations: A Novel Approach to Rapid Rainfall Modelling and Risk Assessment.</title>
                <subtitle />
                <type>Talk</type>

                <abstract>Flooding caused by rainfall poses a significant hazard to Pacific Island nations that are at risk of cyclones and large rainfall events. Particularly, island nations such as Samoa, which are characterised by high mountains and steep river gullies, are highly susceptible to flash flooding events. Despite this recognised threat, a notable absence of reliable, high-quality data hinders the application of traditional hydrodynamic models that typically rely on precise river flow values and often disregard rainfall factors. Furthermore, there is an absence of flood hazard inundation maps that can provide a basic indication and outline the potential consequences of rainfall-induced flooding on both the populace and the environment within these regions.

To address these challenges, the Pacific Risk Tools for Resilience Phase-2 (PARTneR-2) project, co-led by the New Zealand National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) and the Pacific Community (SPC), has introduced a novel approach to rapid rain-on-grid modelling. This methodology uses a combination of open-source geo-spatial software, including QGIS, RAS Mapper, and 2D hydrodynamics software BG-Flood, on limited geo-spatial data to rapidly produce indicative flood depth inundation maps.

Our study has concentrated on two Pacific Island nations: Samoa and Vanuatu. For these two countries, we have developed a series of flood depth inundation maps at national coverage for 10-, 50-, and 100-year Annual Recurrence Intervals (ARI). The model used to produce the maps requires limited input data, is reasonably easy to set up, and can be run in under 12 hours. The maps produced are useful in providing a basic indication of areas that are at the most risk of flooding in a specified rainfall event. The method is cost-effective and can be implemented using entirely open-source software.

Furthermore, by integrating the flood maps produced by this study with geo-spatial asset data sets, particularly focusing on buildings, our study shows how we can quantify the exposure and potential losses to flooding events, employing the Riskscape multi-hazard risk modelling software. The outcomes generated by this innovative method offer valuable insights that can inform resource allocation decisions during the critical hours following a significant rainfall event, particularly in the context of a Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) study.</abstract>

                <duration>00:30</duration>
                <abstract>INTRODUCTION

The development of Gema (Map Manager) and Sisdai (System of Design and Accessibility for Research) is based on two main premises:

1) The information generated with public money should be public and for free.

2) The Mexican government is moving towards technological autonomy and independence; therefore, free software components should be conceived for development and use in the federal public administration.


INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT

Gema and Sisdai have been developed by the Center for Research in Geospatial Information Sciences, A.C. (CentroGeo) and have been coordinated by the National Council of Humanities, Sciences and Technologies (Conahcyt), which is the Mexican government institution responsible for establishing public policies on humanities, sciences, technologies and innovation throughout the country.


ARTICULATION WITH ENI

Conahcyt created the National Informatics Ecosystems (ENI) to make available the results of research funded by the state, publishing open data, information visualizations, analysis and maps that help citizens better understand the country in which they live. 

ENIs are collaborative and open access spaces that contribute to local and regional knowledge to address Mexico's priority problems by storing, processing, analyzing and disseminating humanistic, scientific and technological information. The topics addressed are: toxic agents and polluting processes, water, culture, education, energy and climate change, health, human security, socio-ecological systems and sustainability, food sovereignty and housing.

Gema and Sisdai are articulated with the ENIs, as contributions to open science. All of them are available in public portals.


GEMA

We will begin this talk by asking: is it possible to have a country where the government, academia, civil society, private sector and media collaborate to generate, publish and consume open data? And the answer is simple: this would be ideal, but today it remains a utopia.

Gema is moving towards institutional interoperability, but also exploring the incorporation of data outside the scope of government. 

Conahcyt manages research projects with academia and we all know that historically scientific production has been shared mainly in specialized journals, books and research articles that generally involve payment.

Additionally, what happens to the data used as input in research? It usually remains within the research teams and is not published, hindering replicability, interoperability and methodological contrast.

This project contributes to open science by promoting free access to scientific research products (data, methodology, code, etc.).

In Mexico there are different national instances of data collection, integration and visualization, for example the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI), the Ministry of Health, the National Population Council (Conapo), the Executive Secretariat of the National Public Security System, among others.

To support the analysis and visualization of data, Gema has loaded layers of information from all of the above-mentioned agencies, making it possible to cross-reference official data with information derived from research projects. 

Gema (in English Gem) takes its name from the combination of the first letters of the words “gestor” and “mapas” in Spanish, thus alluding to a precious stone, as well as to the gradual process it takes to become a real precious jewel, such as the constant transformation of data into information and knowledge, which results in an input of great value and importance.  

As a Geospatial Knowledge Infrastructure, created in an open science environment and with accessibility criteria, Gema integrates a free data model, as well as tools so that users can explore, compile, visualize and share geospatial information related to humanistic, scientific and technological activity. 


SISDAI

Beyond being a free software project, it is a design system that allows to establish rules, patterns and practices to ensure the consistency of complex, flexible and constantly evolving digital products. 

Sisdai is built in an interdisciplinary way, considering criteria for accessibility, usability, data visualization, good code practices and user experience. Its structure is based on the atomic design methodology, which proposes that from simple elements -atoms- complex components and functions -organisms- are formed and, in turn, these form functional and robust templates and user interfaces under the same logic to be able to decompose them if necessary.

By using Sisdai you will be able to explore buttons, menus, graphs, maps, components, and others that will allow you to develop accessible interfaces. Also, if your native language is not English, you will have the opportunity to access documented code in Spanish! Sisdai libraries are developed using open source technologies, such as the Vue.js Javascript framework, OpenLayers, D3.js and Git.

Sisdai enhances the social impact of research projects by promoting technological autonomy and independence with the use of free software components. The Sisdai portal aims to enable as many people as possible to perceive, understand, navigate and interact correctly. This includes those with different disabilities: visual, hearing, motor, cognitive or neurological, as well as older adults and those unfamiliar with the Internet. The code repositories, libraries and documentation that comprise it are developed by Mexican work teams where the Spanish language is privileged. 

There are currently 5 public code libraries in institutional repositories available for research teams.


CONCLUSION

ENI-Gema-Sisdai are open projects in favor of the nation, in which collaborations were carried out with more than a dozen research teams, institutions and public centers. There are more than twenty public portals of the ENI project, about 400 geographic layers with free format downloads in Gema and 5 open source libraries in Sisdai. All this is available in public sites.</abstract>

                <duration>00:30</duration>
                <abstract>Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research (INPE) developed the TerraBrasilis web portal as the main link between the land cover data generated by its projects and a wide range of users. In this talk, we will discuss TerraBrasilis' development, updates, and improvements. We built the portal's front-end and back-end using free and open-source software.
INPE’s program named BiomasBR is responsible for long term projects that generate the official data about the Brazilian biomes. These projects process Earth observation satellite images with the goal of generating accurate and timely data to support the country in monitoring and controlling deforestation, forest degradation, forest fire, and other environmental impacts on the Brazilian Amazon forest and other biomes. In this talk, we address specifically the projects PRODES and DETER. The Real Time Deforestation Detection System (DETER) uses Earth observation satellite imagery to map and report changes in forest cover across the Amazon and the Cerrado biome. As a result, DETER produces, every day, sets of polygons, referred to as alerts, that delineate areas where deforestation or degradation (such as mining, forest fire scars, or logging) can be perceived. Each DETER alert includes the image date that generated it, the type of change, and other attributes. DETER uses images from sensors with high temporal resolution and large swath width, with the appropriate spectral bands to detect vegetation cover change. Currently, DETER uses mainly data from the Wild Field Imager (WFI) on board the Amazonia-1 and the China-Brazil Earth Resource Satellite (CBERS-4A). Command-and-control organizations use the data produced by DETER to plan and qualify field actions.
The Legal Amazon Deforestation Satellite Monitoring Project (PRODES) maps, annually, the suppression of native vegetation in Brazil. Initially, the project restricted its scope to the Legal Amazon region, conducting an annual inventory of forest loss dating back to 1988. In 2001, the project expanded its scope to include the monitoring of Cerrado biome. PRODES uses medium resolution imagery with the appropriate spectral bands to detect vegetation cover change. It uses images from the Operational Imager (OLI) sensor on board the Landsat-8 satellite, the Multispectral Camera (MUX) from CBERS-4 and CBERS-4A, and the Multispectral Instrument (MSI) from Sentinel-2. PRODES data has supported long-term public policies to contain native vegetation removal in the Amazon and the Cerrado. Currently, the project has expanded to encompass all Brazilian biomes. PRODES data support public policies, greenhouse gas emission estimates, and can help release international resources associated with conservation, climate, and biodiversity agendas. 
PRODES and DETER generate a large volume of geospatial data useful to a several organizations. Given the strategic importance of these projects, and INPE’s commitment to geospatial open source and open data, the TerraBrasilis portal is the one-stop point to access PRODES and DETER data.  The portal is used by the Brazilian government, academic and private sectors, non-governmental organisations, and the general public interested in environmental issues. As such, TerraBrasilis is a way to ensure INPE’s transparency regarding the environmental data it generates. It allows anyone to explore land cover data without requiring further knowledge.
The main functional requirements and characteristics that guide the development of TerraBrasilis are: multiplicity of users, with different technological backgrounds and different interests; data might be subject to temporal embargo before being public; temporal embargo might be overcome by authorized users; data is related to the same process, but has a distinct production timetable and distinct time granularity; data has to be presented as a web map with the conventional operations of zooming, pan, layer selection, etc.; data summaries should be available with common visualization tools such as graphs, charts, and tables; users need to make comparisons over time and different spatial units of interest, such as municipalities, states, indigenous lands, or conservation units; data can be downloaded in open formats; data can be accessed through open geospatial services.
Considering these requirements TerraBrasilis is designed as a set of multiple independent panels, to expose different views of its geospatial database. A series of scripts connect to the production database and prepare the data for publishing in TerraBrasilis. The publishing database contains over 2 PB of raster and vector data, and this volume increases daily. It contains data for Brazil's entire territory. Some datasets date back to 1988.
PRODES and DETER data are available in distinct web mapping panels that allow the visualization of multiple layers, spatial and temporal filtering, as well as the download of data in open formats such as GeoTIFF and Shapefile. They are also available in interactive dashboards where users can make comparisons over time and different spatial units of interest, such as municipalities, states, or conservation units.
TerraBrasilis uses a service-oriented paradigm that follows interoperable international spatial data standards and the specifications of the Brazilian National Spatial Data Infrastructure (INDE). TerraLib offers Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)-compliant services such as Web Map Service (WMS), Web Feature Service (WFS), Web Service Coverage (WCS) and Catalog Service for the Web (CSW).
TerraBrasilis publishes all of the data generated in DETER and PRODES, and it is constantly evolving. Recently, the portal has developed and integrated some panels that integrate data from PRODES and DETER, along with other data sources such as INPE's vegetation fire monitoring project in Brazil. The Situation Room panel, for example, allows the observation of critical areas of deforestation and vegetation fire, through a series of indicators based on data from DETER and other environmental indicators. In this talk, we will provide a general overview of the portal, the technical aspects of its development, and the data presented in TerraBrasilis.</abstract>

                <abstract>Geographic Information Systems (GIS) have become indispensable tools in public administration, providing essential insights for decision-making. My talk will showcase the application of R, a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics, in creating detailed maps that reveal critical socio-economic and environmental patterns across Brazil. Our work primarily focuses on public health, education, environmental issues, and economic development, demonstrating the transformative power of open-source GIS in governmental institutions.

The data sources for our analysis are primarily open data repositories provided by the government, NGOs, and private institutions. We integrate various datasets, including public expenditure, municipal influence, population, and hospital locations. Statistical tools such as clustering, centrality measures, correlation, chi-square tests, and distribution measures are employed to identify patterns and produce significant graphical elements. We utilize R packages like {geobr} and {spdata} for accessing thematic shapefiles, including states, municipalities, municipal seats, and biomes. Our mapping projects often stem from requests by institutions such as the National Treasury Secretariat and the Vice-Presidency of the Republic, as well as spontaneous contributions to the data science ecosystem.

One of our key findings relates to healthcare access. Cities with low management capacity and influence are typically associated with significant travel distances for hospital care. In the realm of education and human development, public education policies have reshaped the municipal HDI map of Brazil between 1991 and 2010, particularly in the Northeast. In Ceará, education improvements were pivotal in enhancing HDI from 1991 to 2010. The impact of COVID-19 has also been a critical area of focus. By the first anniversary of the epidemic, numerous Brazilian municipalities reported death tolls nearing the total deaths observed from 2014 to 2018.

Climate change exacerbates natural disaster issues in Brazil, notably floods and droughts in Rio Grande do Sul and the Amazon region. Despite most Brazilian homes having at least one bathroom, maps reveal that the North region and Maranhão still have many municipalities with low proportions of homes with bathrooms. Conversely, the South and Southeast regions, especially São Paulo, show high proportions of residences with access to central water supply networks. When considering environmental pressure, many Global South countries see their HDI positions improve, while the Global North, notably Canada, experiences a significant decline.

Economic analysis reveals that in Brazil, five clusters of municipalities are formed based on municipal GDP components. Maps highlight patterns associated with agricultural strength in the West, wealth in São Paulo, and significant economic deprivation in the Northeast and northern Minas Gerais. On a broader scale, Brazil stands out with the largest GDP growth in South America from 1960 to 2023, while Argentina and Venezuela have seen their shares plummet, and Chile remains stable.

The maps generated serve multiple purposes. They are integral to storytelling, dashboards, and publications on platforms like Medium. Some maps are intended solely for internal use by the requesting institutions. Many projects have their codes available on GitHub or Gist, promoting transparency and collaboration within the data science community.

Our work demonstrates the profound impact of using open-source GIS tools in governmental institutions. The ability to visualize and analyze complex data sets in a spatial context has enabled more informed decision-making and public policy development. By sharing our methods and findings, we aim to inspire other governmental bodies to adopt similar practices, ultimately fostering greater transparency and efficiency in public administration.</abstract>

                <abstract>QWC2 (QGIS Web Client 2) is the official web application of QGIS, that allows you to publish your projects with the same rendering, thanks to QGIS Server. The environment is composed of a modern responsive front-end written in JavaScript on top of ReactJS and OpenLayers, and several server-side Python/Flask micro-services to enhance the basic functionalities of QWC2 and QGIS Server.

QWC2 is modular and extensible, and provides both an off-the-shelf web application and a development framework: you can start simple and easy with the demo application, and then customize your application at will, based on your needs and development capabilities.

This talk aims at introducing this application and to show how easy it is to publish your own QGIS projects on the web. An overview of the QWC2 architecture will also be given. It will also be an opportunity to discover the last new features that have been developed in the past year and ideas for future improvements.</abstract>

                <title>Use of Open-Source Software in Census Cartography Production - IBGE's Case</title>
                <subtitle />
                <type>Talk</type>
                <date>2024-12-06T14:00:00-03:00</date>

                <abstract>To showcase the application of free and open-source software (FOSS) in the census cartography works produced within the scope of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). 

Currently linked to the Ministry of Planning and Budget, IBGE is a federal public administration entity. Since its foundation in 1936, it has become the main provider of data and information in the country, meeting the needs of various segments of civil society as well as federal, state, and municipal government entities. Its institutional mission is "to portray Brazil by providing the information required to the understanding of its reality and the exercise of citizenship". To achieve this, it identifies and analyzes the territory, counts the population, shows economic evolution through people’s work and production, while also revealing how they live. 

To support this purpose, IBGE maintains the Territorial Base (TB), a spatial information system supporting the operations of collection, processing, analysis, tabulation, charts, cartograms, and publications of its surveys and censuses. It is also used for evaluations of population estimates by identifying, monitoring, and representing the evolution of the territory, mainly through the development of its census sector network. 

The TB consists of a graphical base of georeferenced information representing territorial structures, census tracts (called sectors) and other elements. These structures can be legal, such as the political-administrative division; analytical, linked to territorial patterns or specific population groups; or operational, intended to guarantee access to and coverage of census units. 

Among the territorial structures that comprise the TB, the census sector underpins the operational organization of censuses and some sample surveys. It is a territorial interview collection unit whose size and number of households and establishments allow the census taker to complete their activities within a specified timeframe. Moreover, it is the basic unit for disseminating census information, allowing public access to statistical results at the smallest spatial range. 
 
In mid-2014, IBGE was moving from a data update model based on a complete review conducted just before a census operation to a continuous update model, which was more complex and required more agile tools and systems for operators. At that time, however, the software used by the TB was commercial, with the update and customization processes for the entity's specific objectives being slow and difficult, as they were tied to contracts with the supplier. This represented a considerable, often prohibitive, expense for public coffers.  

Concurrently, a staff of analysts had formed within IBGE, coming from civil service exams held in previous years for specialized technical jobs. These servers had two synergistic qualities: methodological knowledge of the activities performed by the institution, and some had technical capabilities in systems development. 

Given the scenario, it became feasible to explore an internal alternative for TB update activities. Such a system should meet these technological premises: 

Be based on a free platform without licensing costs, preferably with an open-source codebase to avoid future dependencies; 

Operate with low computational and network requirements to meet the diverse realities of users; 

Be fully customizable to adapt to the needs of the TB and IBGE. 

Given such requirements and considering the technical knowledge and stage of evolution of geoprocessing tools at the time, the system was defined as an external plugin for QGIS (using pyQGIS API) with a graphical interface modeled in Qt framework (using pyQt API). 

The Geographic Information System for the Territorial Base (SIGBT), therefore, is the technological solution that emerged in 2014. Its conception, implementation, and homologation stages were always characterized by constant collaborative development, where TB technicians and related areas of IBGE could participate and contribute in several ways, from signaling problems to suggesting improvements and even writing the code itself. The development of SIGBT was designed modularly, to meet the methodological and conceptual priorities defined by IBGE. 

Its code was primarily written in Python, and the handled data is managed by an SQLite database (with SpatiaLite extension), made available to internal users for download and offline editing from a versioned Git repository. 

Among the main procedures performed by SIGBT are the graphical operations on census sectors (divisions, aggregations, adjustments, and ensuring comparability between previous sector grids) and intra-sector layers (localities, roads, blocks, and block faces). It also ensures the topological and methodological consistency of the edits made. Additionally, the production of maps used in census operations is carried out on SIGBT. 

Since the advent of SIGBT, three major data update cycles aimed at census operations have been conducted using the system: the 2015 Population Count (which was eventually canceled), the 2016 Census of Agriculture, and the 2022 Demographic Census (which prompted two update cycles due to two postponements). 

Currently, SIGBT is in use at the IBGE Coordination of Territorial Structures, in all 27 State Superintendencies, and in most of its over 560 agencies. It comprises about 50 specific functions that automate processes, facilitate edits, and enable the continuous updating of the TB. The system also integrates information from other databases from different areas that interact with the TB, enabling integrated editing and visualization of all data, thus facilitating the construction of territorial occupation indicators at the national level. 

Looking towards the future of SIGBT, the development of new modules for public access is being considered. It is projected that these modules will leverage QGIS navigation resources to offer citizens easier and quicker access to geographic data published by IBGE. 

  

Final Considerations 

The explanation above showcases, through IBGE's experience with SIGBT, the feasibility of using a free software architecture for complex geographical projects with a wide range of geographic applications.  

From a budgetary perspective, the superiority of free software was also verified, as SIGBT has contributed estimated savings that would exceed six figures since its creation, solely from software licensing that is no longer used. 

The SIGBT initiative, therefore, presents itself as a successful example of a system based on free and open-source software, developed by public administration, showing that the use of this type of structure is not only viable but desirable.</abstract>

                <abstract>AmazoniaHack is an open innovation hackathon for the Amazon rainforest. The bilingual program, run in Portuguese is dedicated to support the preservation and rejuvenation of the Amazon Rainforest by fostering open innovation and leveraging technology co-created with indigenous communities, local organizations, and global participants. Our goals are to harmonize technological projects with local context, wisdom, and wishes to develop scalable projects for monitoring and preempting deforestation, to support sustainable land management, and to lower barriers to entry into the environmental innovation space. We further seek to foster a culture of inclusive innovation, where technologies co-developed with partners at hackathons serve as tools complementing and advancing traditional knowledge and practices.  We will share lessons learned and key takeaways from AmazoniaHack. We also share a call to action for the global open source geospatial community to support the incubation of an open source movement focused on combating deforestation in the Amazon.

AmazoniaHack aims to provide multiple long-term benefits, including our goal this year to elevate Indigenous science in conservation solutions, and the ongoing accelerated deployment of hardware for acoustic monitoring of deforestation, as well as software and geospatial solutions. However, the primary beneficiaries of the two-day hackathon are Brazilian students who may otherwise be excluded from environmental innovation spaces. We have had dozens of students contact the organizing team after each event to ask if AmazoniaHack will take place every year, to seek support on continuing to work on their projects, to connect with hackathon partners, and to speak about their careers. This exemplifies some of the target impact of our transformative environmental education approach - collaboration and partnership development, impact on career paths, and knowledge and attitude shift towards specific environmental challenges.</abstract>

                <title>Using Route Optimization Algorithms to Improve Sanitation Service Delivery</title>

                <abstract>To address the urgent need for affordable, high quality, non-sewered sanitation solutions for urban residents, our organization distributes and manages urine-diverting, container-based toilets with accompanying safe emptying, transportation, and treatment of waste through a subscription model in urban informal settlements. Our goal is to reach one million residents over the next five years at a cost of less than $5 per person per year. To achieve this goal, we need to invest in scalable and efficient systems, particularly for waste collection logistics. 

Currently, our waste collection routing and scheduling is performed manually and unsystematically. Managers decide which toilets to collect from each day based on filling rate data and assign a cluster of toilets to each waste collector. Collectors then have the autonomy to choose their own route for collecting those toilets based on their knowledge of the location and movement paths in the area. The process is time consuming, provides opportunities for expensive inefficiencies in routes, and is not scalable. To improve and automate the process, we leveraged route planning algorithms by modifying and piloting an existing route optimization tool. In the first phase of the project, we collected data for the tool such as GPS coordinates of toilets, locations of intermediate holding points where collectors can consolidate collections, considerations that collectors currently make when planning their routes, and challenges they face. We were also able to use existing street maps from OSM that included both formal roads and informal footpaths, which is critical data for the tool to perform well. The routes generated by the updated tool were estimated to reduce collection time by 48% and distance traveled by 62%. In the current phase of the project we are syncing the tool with our Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system to reduce the need for manual data entry and with an open-source mobile application( (OSMAnd) that will provide turn-by-turn navigation instructions based on the routes produced from the tool. We will then conduct a pilot in the Mathare informal settlement in Nairobi to measure actual time saved by using the tool for collections.</abstract>

                <abstract>In 2015, the City of São Paulo launched GeoSampa, a platform providing access to a variety of cadastral data, maps, satellite images, and information on zoning, land use, urban infrastructure, land subdivision, and public areas for both municipal technicians and the general public. GeoSampa serves as a data repository, allowing different departments to share their information and keep it updated on the platform. A notable example is the Licensing Department, which in 2015 presented a geographic database solution using open-source software, with Linux, Postgres, PostGIS, Python, and QGIS, for land subdivision processes. These initiatives solved major problems and streamlined work processes, highlighting the importance of a data-sharing culture among public agencies for urban development.
The work developed by the Licensing Department was summarized in the experience cataloged by CEBRAP in a program called COPI-COLA, whose content can be seen in full on the CEBRAP website  https://cebrap.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Guia_5.pdf. This program adopted an innovative approach by using open-source software to develop and maintain the system, significantly reducing implementation costs and making team work more efficient and integrated. Other areas also benefited from the organized and available information on GeoSampa, serving as an example for public agencies across the country.
This work specifically aims to show two technical examples of codes used in the Geographic Database mentioned above, which I developed, highlighting the practical benefits of collaboration and technological innovation in the public sector using open-source software.
Example 1
According to Ordinance No. 957/GC3 of 2015, issued by the Brazilian Aeronautics Command (COMAER), guidelines are established for the creation and management of Airport Protection Zones (ZPA). The objective is to ensure the safety and efficiency of air operations by preventing obstacles and activities that could interfere with air navigation. The ordinance details the competencies of municipalities and other bodies in monitoring and controlling these areas, as well as defining specific restrictions for land use near airports.
Due to the large volume of licensing requests, if all enterprises were subject to DECEA's evaluation, there would be a need to increase DECEA's team, resulting in approval delays. To mitigate this problem, the implementation of a geographic system, to be used by the City of São Paulo, could select only cases in regions where DECEA's action was necessary.
A system using Linux, Postgres, PostGIS, and QGIS was developed by the department's technicians with validation from DECEA's technicians. This optimized processes, reducing DECEA's workload and shortening approval times. Our objective is to briefly present how this system was developed and its impact on time savings and information security.
Example 2
The work consisted of creating an algorithm to comply with Article 131 of Law No. 16.402/2016. "The use of properties, for the purposes of land subdivision, use, and occupation discipline, is classified as permitted or not permitted and as compliant or non-compliant. § 2º Use not permitted in the location is that which cannot be implemented or installed on the property due to the zone and the street width." Street width is defined as the distance between property alignments, including the carriageway and public walkway.
We used the cartographic bases of the City of São Paulo, surveyed in 2004, for geoprocessing. The tool used was the QGIS software (Geographic Information System - GIS), the official project of the Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo). The Licensing and Urban Development Department's (SMUL) database on street widths at the time (2018) covered between 35% and 40% of the city's streets. The database had low reliability, as measurements were taken randomly at three different points on the street segment, making it visually impossible to pinpoint where the width is smallest, thus preventing proper application of the above law. Measurements not included in this database would be taken in loco by subprefecture technicians and sent to the Licensing Department's Cadastre Division for completion. This database gathered measurements taken over time and was not available to the public.
The work presented here was developed using scripts in PyQGIS, which combines the Python programming language with QGIS APIs, allowing for automated geometry tracing. The created code used all street segments and traced all elevations from the nodes created in the block layers, choosing the minimum elevation. This work does not eliminate the need for in loco measurements, but like in Example 1, selects the necessary cases, significantly reducing the number of visits and increasing reliability for proper law enforcement.
Conclusion
The success of GeoSampa and associated projects reveals that using open-source tools promotes transparency and accessibility of geographic information, strengthening citizen participation and facilitating urban planning, making cities smarter and more sustainable.
As a developer of this project, I feel immense pride in having contributed to this digital and technological transformation in public administration. Seeing the positive impact of our work is extremely gratifying.
Ultimately, São Paulo's example can inspire other cities to adopt similar practices, contributing to a future where technology and innovation serve efficient and inclusive urban development. Thus, the cartographic transition from map library to geoprocessing marks a new era in public administration, where geographic information is a valuable resource for decision-making and improving quality of life in cities.</abstract>

                <abstract>In a humanitarian context, data collection can be divided into two main categories: proactive collection of data that may be useful for disaster response and recovery; reactive collection that is required to assess the situation on the ground during an event.

The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team has supported both types of mapping through the Tasking Manager platform. Going forward we will also be able to collect drone imagery collaboratively and add collected field-data to complement and match to the remote data, with the Drone TM and Field Mapping TM (FMTM) respectively.

There are often major hurdles for field-based data collection:
1.  	How to effectively collaborate with multiple data collectors at the same time.
2.  	How to work when there is poor connectivity in an area.

Web applications may be an acceptable choice to solve the first issue, but typically perform poorly when subjected to the second.

With a new paradigm in web development, local-first applications, this may no longer be an issue.

We can develop web-based applications that allow for both:
-          Real-time update for users undertaking collaborative data collection campaigns.
-          Fully offline data collection capability, with syncing and conflict resolution once connectivity is restored.

These capabilities have been achieved through some major landmarks over time:
-          Addition of WASM to the browser in 2017.
-          Implementation of databases in the web-browser (SQLite, Postgres), using WASM.
-          Introduction of smart data reconciliation mechanisms such as CRDTs.
-          Continual improved access to mobile phones globally, particularly in the introduction of high-performance smart phones.

This talk explores our journey implementing a local-first field mapping flow, with an example and demo to demonstrate its efficacy.</abstract>

                <abstract>In this presentation, we will explore a practical example of using GeoServerCloud within a local cluster, specifically focusing on catalog configuration in the database. We'll simplify the complex process of deploying an application in a Kubernetes cluster using Helm. This task is challenging, especially when the application has a microservices architecture. Our goal is to bridge the technical gap, ensuring developers don't need to become DevOps experts to integrate GeoServerCloud into their applications.</abstract>

                <abstract>The integration of open-source data into climate policy has immense potential to enhance climate adaptation and mitigation efforts globally. This talk addresses the existing gaps in the utilization of open-source data by decision-makers and explores sustainable funding models for these initiatives. 

 Case Studies:

1. Assessing Climate-Related Disaster Damage Using EMDAT:
   The Emergency Events Database (EMDAT) provides critical open-source data on the damage caused by climate-related disasters. This data is invaluable for developing countries to assess their vulnerabilities and prioritize areas for climate adaptation funding from the Green Climate Fund (GCF). By using EMDAT, countries can make informed decisions to prevent future damage and allocate resources more effectively.

2. Using OpenStreetMap (OSM) Data for Small Island Developing States:
   In small island developing states (SIDS), the use of OSM data has been instrumental in assessing average travel times to urban centers. This analysis highlighted the high transactional costs due to fragmented geographies, providing policymakers with concrete evidence to address these challenges. By leveraging OSM data, these countries can improve infrastructure planning and reduce costs, enhancing their resilience to climate impacts.

 Focus Areas:

1. Gaps in Competencies:
   Despite the availability of valuable open-source data, there remains a significant gap in its usage by policymakers. Data specialists often conduct in-depth analyses that are not easily accessible or understandable to policymakers. Bridging this gap requires improved collaboration and communication between data specialists and policymakers.

2. Enhancing Data Literacy:
   Policymakers need better data literacy to fully utilize the benefits of open-source data. Training and capacity-building initiatives can empower them to make data-driven decisions, fostering a culture of evidence-based policy-making in climate adaptation and mitigation.

3. Sustainable Funding for Open Source Initiatives:
   Many open-source projects suffer from intermittent funding, threatening their sustainability. Innovative funding models, such as public-private partnerships, crowdfunding, and subscription-based services, can ensure continuous support and development of open-source data platforms.

Challenges for Small Landmass Countries:
   Countries with small landmasses, particularly SIDS, often face limitations in accessing open-source data due to satellite coverage gaps and network connectivity issues. Addressing these challenges requires tailored solutions, such as deploying drones for localized data collection and improving internet infrastructure.

Conclusion:
   To maximize the benefits of open-source data for climate action, it is crucial to close the competency gap between data specialists and policymakers. By enhancing data literacy among policymakers and ensuring sustainable funding for open-source initiatives, countries can better harness these tools to develop robust, data-driven climate policies. This talk aims to shed light on these critical issues and propose actionable solutions to bridge existing gaps and promote effective climate decision-making.</abstract>

                <title>Integrating Earth Observation Data for Enhanced Health Response Systems: The EODCtHRS component of HARMONIZE Project</title>
                <subtitle />
                <type>Talk</type>

                <abstract>The lack of an integrated understanding of the connections between extreme weather events, environmental degradation, socioeconomic disparities, and their impacts on infectious disease outbreaks heightens the risk of disease spread. This issue is particularly critical in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region, where vulnerable communities have been more frequently affected by these events. The HARMONIZE project goal is to create digital toolkits that stakeholders in climate change hotspots can use to combine data about the environment, climate and health cost-effectively to monitor and send out alerts about a set of diseases that are affected by its effect.

This talk will give an overview of the Earth Observation Data Cube tuned for Health Response Systems (EODCtHRS), an HARMONIZE Project component. The EODCtHRS presents a technical-scientific proposal termed HARMONIZE Instance composed of back/front-end solutions developed using free and open-source software for integration and interoperability between specific sets of health, environmental and climate data and the digital infrastructure of the Brazil Data Cube (BDC) project of the National Institute for Space Research (INPE). 

The development of this proposal was divided into four working streams, Drone, Health, Climate, and Data Science Environment modules. Furthermore, we developed a custom version of the web platform for data visualization and analysis of these sources based on BDC Explorer 3.0 (https://brazildatacube.dpi.inpe.br/portal/explore), which presents improved capabilities for discovering, visualizing, and downloading data cubes from remote sensing images (https://brazildatacube.dpi.inpe.br/harmonize/dev/portal/explore). An Harmonize Instance ALPHA Version has been generated.

The core background of this platform is the SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) specification which defines a way to store and search data using spatial and temporal operations. The STAC enables the harmonization of data from different sources and maintains interoperability between all system parts. The solution utilizes a suite of technologies from  Python and R environments in addition to PostgreSQL/PostGIS and GeoServer needed to store and publish data collections.

Below we present a brief description of each working stream:

Module 1 - Drone image: The main goal of drone image integration in the context of EODCtHRS is to provide a data infrastructure that meets the demands of health surveillance, especially in areas considered hotspots of climate change. Consequently, we started exploring the integration of the images generated by fieldwork campaigns in some locations of Pará State. The processing of these images is based on auxiliary information (course angle and flight height) and EXIF and TIFF metadata tags to support the conversion of the raw images into Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) files ideal for integration with STAC specification implemented by BDC infrastructure. Besides that, mosaics were created using the OpenDroneMap application.  The Alpha version of these data collections (scenes/mosaics) has been published as layers with GeoServer and associated metadata available in STAC catalogs.

Module 2 - Health data: This module integrates health data for the EODCtHRS, including information from different stakeholders, mainly Fiocruz's Health Information Laboratory (LIS) and the InfoDengue initiative. Both projects produce health indicators, considering the impacts of environmental and climate change on the Brazilian population. The module also covers the development of two main packages.

The first, called EODCtHRS Health Indicator Processing (EHIPR), was developed in Python to obtain health indicators from CSV and Parquet files, aggregate them spatially and temporally, spatialize them and accommodate them on the HARMONIZE platform . Second, called EODCtHRS Data PUblisher (EDPU), is a package developed in Python to publish the HARMONIZE datasets as a layer in GeoServer and its metadata in STAC Catalog to make available at the HARMONIZE Explorer. All sources of data (drone images, climate and health indicators) used the EDPU package to publish the ALPHA version of collections produced in the context of the HARMONIZE project. 

Module 3 - Climate data: This module integrates climatological data for EODCtHRS, enabling direct query execution via access interfaces, and eliminating the need for data transfer. Within the project's scope, we consider products produced by Fiocruz team from the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), which the European Centre implements for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA5-Land reanalysis dataset and available by the Center for Weather Forecasting and Climate Studies (CPTEC/INPE): SAMeT and MERGE.
 
This module developed the EODCtHRS R Climate Processing Package (rclimpr) to generate climate indicators. The rclimpr uses scripts to extract indicators like temperature and precipitation from netCDF files through spatial and temporal aggregations (epidemiological weeks and months). It outputs raster files in COG format and vector formats like GeoJSON and Shapefile, providing suitable data formats for analysis and visualization.

Module 4 - The Geospatial Data Science Environment (BDC-Lab) aims to provide a set of geospatial data analysis tools integrated with BDC data, avoiding the necessity to download large amounts of Earth Observation data and allowing researchers to produce deep analysis using tools such as RStudio, QGIS, Metview, VSCode and Jupyter Notebooks with several R and Python geospatial libraries pre-installed. Currently, it is in an experimental phase, where some users are testing its functionalities and providing feedback for its improvement. 

This talk proposal presents an overview of a software environment developed to harmonize Earth observation, environmental, climate, and health data aiming to provide ways to visualize, analyze, monitor, and alert for spreading diseases in climate change hotspots in LAC region. The development of the HARMONIZE Instance has demonstrated the utility of geoservices and technologies, with standard infrastructure and protocols, as an effective way to harmonize different data formats from diverse data sources in the health context.

The HARMONIZE project is financed by the Wellcome Trust (https://wellcome.org) grant number 224694/Z/21/Z, through the  Foundation for Scientific and Technological Development In Health (FIOTEC)  ID Project: ICICT-002-FEX-22.</abstract>

                <abstract>Map Kibera arose from a desire to expand OSM beyond the confines of Europe and North America. In 2009, it pushed the boundaries of what then-new technologies could do. What have the mappers learned over the years? This talk will welcome you to Nairobi and through the ups and downs of mapping in Kenya - from the history of mapping in 20th Kenya, through Map Kibera’s start, into slums and rural parts of Kenya, and finally to current-day Kibera, where mappers are mapping street lights, waste disposal, schools, and more. How has Map Kibera and OSM had a community impact even as drones, satellite technology and AI are revolutionizing mapping? What has changed, and what has remained the same?  We will discuss the global impact of Map Kibera, on community-based mapping in OSM and on the general application of technology in developing countries. 
This talk will include a discussion of mapping in Kenya dating back to the colonial era, the establishment of Kibera as a region of Nairobi, and its growth into a massive informal settlement. Kibera has been viewed as a place to develop by the Kenya government, International aid agencies, charities, and missionaries. It was a flashpoint of the post-election violence of 2007/8.
Map Kibera’s Kenyan leaders will discuss the most recent mapping and local impacts made by the use of OSM. Mapping of street lights in Kibera led to new and more street lights installed in Kibera. Mapping of waste management in Mukuru led to the placement of dumping waste bins. Data on schools has led to a pilot project to install solar panels on selected schools. None of these impacts have been easy, but we will share lessons learned about OSM, open data and communities. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of emerging and ever-changing technology, and the fate of the techno-optimism of the early 21st century.</abstract>

                <title>Create a overlay layer with attribute values by finding overlap and gap across multiple and in large polygon layers.</title>
                <subtitle />
                <type>Talk</type>

                <abstract>What we mean here is that if we analyze 5 layers with 5 attribute columns in each layer and we have no spatial overlaps inside each layer. One spatial area may have from zero to 25 possible attribute values. If we have internal overlaps  in each layer also, there is no limit for how many attribute values a spatial area may have. To do this we have to resolve all overlaps and gaps across all involved polygons. 

Is the "Simple Feature" data model for polygons and corresponding methods like ST_Intersection, ST_Difference and ST_Simplify(PreserveTopology) on the polygons a good choice?

NIBIO has been utilizing https://github.com/larsop/esri_union based on "Simple Feature" for almost a decade for ROG operations. However, we believe we've reached a size and complexity limit with "Simple Feature" alone. 

Also doing polygon border generalization/smooth/simplify work is difficult when working with polygons that intersects, because "Simple Feature" polygons is based on a data structure that does not contain info about other related polygons. That information has to be computed every time it’s needed.

While working with “Simple Feature”, NIBIO has also used and sponsored Postgis and Postgis Topology work for many years, which has elevated our ROG work.

A major issue with Postgis Topology is that the edges that construct the surfaces are exposed as separate persistent data objects and for instance we can easy check if all edge are used to split surfaces or not. This feature is absent for "Simple Feature" data type. For a WMS showing surfaces where simplification is not required, "Simple Feature" may be perfect. The problems begins when we need to compute relations for complex and multiple large layers due to the lack of abstractions of border and border relations in "Simple Feature".

Relying solely on "Simple Feature" for spatial work is akin to saying, "I don’t need to transfer any company customer registers into a relational database because I can manage update, consistency checks, and data extraction with Excel macros and other utils". And why care about “one address” that are registered 2 times in a spreed sheet as long they equal? When a single person was responsible for updating the customer address register in the Excel sheet, they would encounter no concurrency issues either. So many have clung on to Excel for years to avoid the perceived "complexity" of relational databases.

In 2016, I presented "Postgis Topology will replace simple feature", can be in the same gate as saying "Relational databases will replace Excel". Both these statements are flawed. A better title in 2016 would be “Postgis Topology extends the limitations related to Simple Feature”, in the same way that relational databases extend limitations related to tabular data in Excel.

A common complaint about Postgis Topology is that it's too complex to setup, use and update, in a way this is similar to how people argument for not moving tabular data in to relational databases.

To simplify and make Postgis Topology more easy accessible, NIBIO has made these repositories available:

https://gitlab.com/nibioopensource/pgtopo_update_sql 
https://gitlab.com/nibioopensource/pgtopo_update_rest 
https://gitlab.com/nibioopensource/pgtopo_update_gui.

Another critique is, "Postgis Toplogy does not scale". Similarly, a customer register created without indexing the foreign key column will not scale in a relational database either. In 2018, we managed to push 100 billion spatially and time-located weather observations from Netcdfs files into PostgreSQL at a rate of about 35 million observations per second using copy, unlogged, partitioned tables, and other tools. The key to performance is to work according to the rules of your relational database, which can be complex,  but relational databases do scale. 

Here https://gitlab.com/nibioopensource/resolve-overlap-and-gap/ (now while waiting for Postgis 3.5 we work in branch https://gitlab.com/nibioopensource/resolve-overlap-and-gap/-/tree/performance_and_robustnes_spike_remove?ref_type=heads ) we use diverse technologies to manage datasets with around 80 million polygons and more than a billion points through Postgis Topology. Large jobs like this are broken down into thousands of smaller tasks, and the abstraction/normalization of edges in Postgis Topology is crucial for this. This kind division of tasks may also prepare us for GPU architecture in the future.

With ROG, it's simple to create a new "Simple Feature" layer with no overlaps or gaps using the Postgis Topology structure and distinct on face_id. To control what input data source to use when we have overlaps inside one data source and/or across many data sources, you can do a simple order by attribute values and limit 1. And we do NOT duplicate any attribute values from the different input sources, because we point back to the original datasets and reuse the indexes there.

In this presentation we will go more in detail on how we do use Postgis Topolgy in the ROG work and focus more on what obstacles that has been and are causing problems.</abstract>

                <abstract>As geospatial data systems grow in scale and complexity, automating the deployment, scaling, and management of geospatial servers becomes increasingly critical. This talk presents Quarticle’s innovative solution to automating GeoServer management using Kubernetes (K8S) operators. GeoServer is a powerful open-source server for sharing geospatial data, but its deployment and management in cloud-native environments can pose challenges.

We will dive into how Quarticle, a company specializing in cloud-native applications and geospatial data solutions, developed a Kubernetes Operator tailored for GeoServer. This operator simplifies the management of GeoServer instances, enabling seamless automated deployments, scaling, updates, and configuration management in a Kubernetes environment.</abstract>

                <abstract>As geospatial data users and developers, we often encounter industry standards for data formats, posing challenges for collaborative projects with sectors like Architecture, Engineering, and Construction, which have diverse data formats and conventions.

Professionals in these fields often struggle with transferring data between QGIS, Rhino, Revit, Grasshopper, and other platforms and web services. Speckle, an open source platform simplifies data and model exchange between urban design, architecture, and engineering software, fostering collaboration and automation; it enables this to all happen as a result of a single click! In this presentation, we will share simple workflows using Speckle  to unlock the power of your GIS data.

Speckle's open nature serves multiple purposes:

- GIS Users: Focus on your tasks and avoid technical data misalignments. Align data location-wise and interoperably, and collaborate in real-time via an interactive web interface with a 3D viewer.

- Developers: Extract real-time data insights, automate workflows and data checks, and build custom apps and integrations using Speckle's infrastructure (3D viewer, SDKs, data access, and authentication).
- Managers: Gain full control of your data with location- and provider-agnostic server setups, custom data access and permissions, time efficiency gains, change tracking, and dashboards.

Speckle's flexible schema facilitates easy conversion to and from other native formats and enables  data querying. A recent update includes integration with the OGC API standard, making Speckle data accessible to any client using the OGC API without extra plugins or scripts. This means that a master plan drawn by an architect in AutoCAD can be instantly mapped as a WFS layer via Speckle.

                <abstract>Reflections from a research study on GIS in secondary schools in South Africa resulted in the development of a collaborative certification for high school students. The study showed a need for more research into how GIS can be used more in secondary school pedagogy.  Results of a study done by the author on the status of GIS teaching in secondary schools in South Africa is investigated with the aim to determine if the use of Open Source software such as QGIS and open data such as OSM would facilitate the use of GIS as a teacher intervention. Teachers who participated in the study overwhelming agree that there are numerous benefits to using GIS in the classroom. They also expressed a keen willingness to attend GIS courses and learn more about FOSS4G tools. This study also showed how FOSS4G empowers teachers with the means to create exciting, real and relevant teaching content. A sample group evaluated how practical GIS lessons using QGIS and OSM can be used to teach geospatial skills.
What this research study concluded is that comprehensive teacher training is required to make GIS practical lessons more effective in the classroom. This resulted in the development of a certified GIS course for teachers and the development of a coordinated Project Base Learning (PBL) task, which was named the Geospatial Data Science Certificate (GDSC). The GDSC is sponsored by Kartoza, endorsed by the Independent Examination Board (IEB), the Southern African Geography Teachers’ Association (SAGTA) and the University of Pretoria at a nominal cost to make it accessible to all students.  A pilot project was conducted over 2002 and launched in 2023 and the author believes it is ready to evolve into an international ‘Geolympiad’ whereby students can collaborate globally to solve real, pertinent issues.</abstract>

                <abstract>The newly established Copernicus Global Land Cover and Tropical Forest Mapping and Monitoring service (LCFM), coordinated by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) and implemented by a consortium led by VITO, marks a significant advancement in land cover mapping. Building on the 100 m Copernicus Global Land Cover layers (2015-2019), LCFM integrates insights from ESA’s WorldCover and Horizon2020 REDDCopernicus projects to deliver a dynamic global land cover service at 10 m resolution for the years 2020-2026.

LCFM will provide global sub-annual (i.e., monthly) land surface features and categories at 10 m resolution, consolidating them into annual land cover maps and tropical forest monitoring products. These data products will be of high quality, free, and open to all users in line with the principles of the Copernicus program. Additionally, LCFM will also release the training data used in its workflows, supporting transparency and fostering further research and development within the community.

A key aspect of LCFM is its foundation on open-source software. Production processes will be conducted on the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem (CDSE) and will be based on the Python ecosystem and the openEO platform. The processing workflows and developed software will be open-sourced and released together with the data products ensuring transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration.

                <abstract>In an era where data is increasingly becoming open and accessible, leveraging this wealth of information effectively is crucial. Our presentation, "Exploring OpenData: dynamic rendering of OvertureMaps with GeoServer and WFS without local storage," showcases an innovative proof of concept that addresses this need.

This project demonstrates how to efficiently consume and dynamically render geospatial data from OvertureMaps without the necessity of local data storage. By utilizing a Web Feature Service (WFS) gateway, we access OvertureMaps data directly from its original source. This approach eliminates the need for intermediate data storage, reducing overhead and streamlining the process of rendering dynamic maps.

The integration of OvertureMaps with GeoServer through WFS enables real-time data rendering, allowing users to visualize up-to-date geographical information without having to handle large datasets themselves. This method not only enhances data accessibility but also optimizes performance by leveraging the capabilities of GeoServer to render data dynamically on-the-fly.

Our presentation will delve into the technical aspects of implementing this proof of concept, discussing the integration process between OvertureMaps, WFS, and GeoServer.</abstract>

                <title>Workshop on Use of GPSSample, a tool for Enumeration, Navigation and Sampling in Health Surveys</title>
                <subtitle />
                <type>Short Workshop</type>
                <date>2024-12-02T14:00:00-03:00</date>

                <abstract>What is GPSSample App?
GPSSample is an Android-based mobile application to facilitate rapid statistical sampling and navigation back to selected locations in the field when conducting household surveys and rapid assessments. The app is designed to streamline the enumeration and statistical sampling process and can be used in areas with limited internet and cell phone connectivity. 

Why is it important?
The 2018 World Health Organization guidance for vaccination coverage cluster surveys recommends that routine immunization coverage surveys use probability sampling methods and generally use census data derived from enumeration areas as the sampling frame. 
•	Existing process: As many countries lack up-to-date population sampling frames, teams are often sent to map and list households (HHs) in enumeration areas using a set of devices. Upon returning to an area with wifi, data from each device must be uploaded to a server, collated, and reviewed to ensure that no sections of the enumeration areas (EAs) were missed during mapping. Once the sampling frame is verified, a sample of HHs can be drawn and another team is deployed to navigate to selected HHs to conduct the coverage survey. 
•	Improved process: By streamlining this enumeration, statistical sampling, and survey process into a single field visit, GPSSample can substantially reduce time and costs associated with conducting coverage surveys, which has broad benefits to ministries of health and public health partners. In GPSSample, teams can collect foundational public health systems data used in providing services to the most vulnerable populations such as locations of health facilities and vaccination points and missing villages in hard-to-reach places that are often overlooked in microplanning efforts for immunization services.

How does it work?

Enumeration teams can use GPSSample to rapidly enumerate HHs in an EA. Teams can send encrypted data to a supervisor via new local-only mobile hotspot QR code technology developed for GPSSample. The supervisor easily presses a button to generate a simple random sample from eligible HHs and sends the list of selected HHs back to the teams. Using GPSSample, teams can navigate back to the selected HHs to conduct surveys. GPSSample integrates seamlessly with other survey tools like OpenDataKit or XLSForm apps.  

GPSSample app has tiered roles facilitating study design and implementation and securely transfers data from GPSSample to ODK and Kobo Collect for participants to conduct the longer household survey. 
Tiered roles:  
•	The Admin sets up the configuration for an area, study questions, and defines sampling design  
•	The Supervisor defines teams, manages field work, selects sample, reviews data from listing and from survey 
•	The Enumerator maps and lists households, collects points of interest, syncs data with supervisor 
•	The Data Collector navigates back to selected sample, and completes the longer survey 


Selected Use Cases
•	HH  surveys: A district-level HH malaria survey is planned to estimate malaria prevalence. 14 HHs will be selected in each cluster. High precision is required as the country is approaching elimination. GPSSample is used to map HHs in clusters and capture structure eligibility for the HH survey and an upcoming indoor residual spraying (IRS) campaign in the app. Three teams working in a cluster sync data with their field supervisor who draws the sample in GPSSample the same day listing finishes. In GPSSample, teams use points of interest and HH listing details just collected to navigate to HHs selected for the HH survey. A month later, IRS teams use IRS eligibility data to ensure all eligible HHs have been visited.
•	Zero dose children: Children missing the first dose of diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP) containing vaccine (“zero dose”) account for an estimated 50% of vaccine-preventable deaths. Zero dose children are challenging to identify since they often reside in urban areas, remote communities, or conflict-affected areas, where population estimates are unreliable. By offering the ability to rapidly conduct enumeration and mapping of targeted areas, GPSSample provides a valuable solution for identifying zero dose children. Through HH listing, GPS coordinates and contextual information can be collected, ensuring precise HH location and incorporating details into digital catchment maps. In conflict zones with restricted team mobility, satellite imagery and mapathons are used to identify inhabited structures. Once structures are identified, teams can safely conduct HH listing to gather information on zero dose individuals. GPSSample streamlines the zero-dose listing process.


Workshop Objectives 
Participants will gain an applied knowledge of the GPSSample application and experience setting up the application for a household cluster field study. 

By the end of the workshop, participants will gain applied experience to:
•	Explain the tiered role of GPSSample application
•	Set up a new configuration and study within GPSSample with a mapping and listing questionnaire, sampling configuration, and link to an ODK household survey
•	Create clusters directly in GPSSample by drawing, specifying a size, or walking the perimeter or bringing in known boundaries 
•	Use Android tablets or phones (OS 8+) to navigate to a cluster, use GPSSample to map and list households and points of interest, and to sync data to and from devices
•	Experience the ease of sampling in an offline field environment and navigating back to selected households
•	Decrypt example field data using the GPSSample Decoder App

While GPSSample is designed for health surveys, it can be used in other scientific fields too.</abstract>

                <abstract>Artificial intelligence is disrupting many fields of knowledge. The Geoscience domain is not exempt from such disruptions. For that reason, understanding machine learning workflows is crucial. This workshop aims to demystify artificial intelligence (AI) for geospatial applications, introducing key concepts, tools, and techniques. Participants will gain hands-on experience with open-source AI tools and learn the fundamentals of AI and its practical applications in geospatial science. We will work with Jupyter notebooks and Python. The workshop will focus on machine learning, specifically in unsupervised and supervised machine learning approaches. In this way, participants will be able to get a basic understanding of artificial intelligence and how it can be applied. 

During the first part of the workshop, instructors will dedicate a few minutes to setting up the basis of AI by introducing key concepts required to build a GEO AI project. During the second part of the workshop, participants will develop geo-AI projects concerning supervised classification, regression, and clustering. They will also apply common metrics for model performance evaluation and visualize the results. There will be opportunities for questions and discussions during the last part of the session.</abstract>

                <description>In this workshop, we will go through the complete fieldwork process: setting up your QGIS project, publishing the project via QFieldCloud, collecting data via the QField mobile app and synchronising the field data back to your main dataset in the office.
QField works on top of QGIS and allows users to set up maps and forms in QGIS on their workstation and deploy them in the field. QField uses QGIS's data providers - OGR, GDAL, PostGIS and others - and supports most common file formats.
QField combines a minimal design with sophisticated technology that allows intuitive viewing and editing of data. QField's map rendering is supported by the QGIS rendering engine, so the results are identical and the full range of styling options available on the desktop is available. Editing forms in QField respect the QGIS configuration and are optimised for touch interaction.
QFieldCloud will also make field collaboration much easier. We will learn about configuring users with different rights, collecting offline and online data, and synchronising field data and QGIS project data.

Attendees should have a device with QField and an account on QFieldCloud.</description>

                <description>PostGIS, sitting on top of Postgresql, is by most metrics, the most popular spatial database. Many videos are online about how to install and use PostGIS....many are from prior FOSS4G conferences and do a good job in getting you to understand the basics. Most of them, however, only scratch the surface when it comes to the power that can be wielded with PostGIS.

This workshop seeks to explore a wide array of functions that may be used on a regular basis or are outside the scope of common spatial queries.. These include, but are not limited to:
- Linear Referencing
- Clustering
- Rasters analytics
- Vector Tiles

There will also be an emphasis on exposing PostGIS data and functions to the web, to this end, there will be some usage of other software products (for example: Martin Vector tile server or pg_featureserv or pg_tileserv  or PostgREST). Consideration will also be given to the ecosystem around PostGIS (For example: ogr_fdw)</description>

                <title>Brazil Data Cube Platform: Earth observation data cubes and satellite image time series analysis</title>
                <subtitle />
                <type>Workshop</type>

                <abstract>This workshop will address the data products and software tools of the Brazil Data Cube Platform (http://brazildatacube.org/). The Brazil Data Cube (BDC) project is producing more than 2 petabytes of Analysis-Read Data (ARD) and multidimensional data cubes of satellite images Landsat-8/-9, Sentinel-2, CBERS-4/-4A and Amazonia for the entire Brazilian territory. Besides that, the BDC project is developing software tools to deal with big data sets, to extract image time series from Earth observation (EO) data cubes and to produce land use and land cover information using image time series and machine learning. 

This workshop will address concepts of EO data cubes and satellite image time series analysis as well as promote hands-on activities using Python language for: (1) Discovering, accessing and viewing EO data cubes; (2) Extraction of satellite image time series from EO data cubes; (3) Analysis of satellite image time series; and (4) Extraction of land use and land cover trajectories. All software tools of the BDC platform will be demonstrated: BDCExplorer, TerraCollect, Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) R package and the web services, SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC), Web Time Series Service (WTSS) and  Web Land Trajectory Service (WLTS). 

The main goal of the BDC is to support environmental monitoring, land use and land cover applications, agricultural management, and other applications that require consistent and temporally structured EO satellite images and geospatial information. Image time series extracted from EO data cubes improve our understanding of environmental patterns and processes. Instead of selecting individual images from specific dates and comparing them, researchers can track change continuously. Satellite image time series analysis captures subtle changes in ecosystems and improves the quality of land classification.

BDC provides ARD and multidimensional data cubes of images from sensors onboard Landsat-8, Landsat-9, Sentinel-2, CBERS-4, CBERS-4A and AMAZONIA-1 satellites. Products like MOD13Q1 and MYD13Q1, which are derived from TERRA/MODIS and AQUA/MODIS satellite/sensor are also incorporated into BDC as data cubes. Using the same technologies to produce EO data cubes, BDC also produces Visualization Mosaics. BDC manages more than 2 petabytes of data, which brings big data challenges. Thus, the BDC platform also provides software tools to efficiently deal with these big EO data sets. 

The software tools of the BDC platform that will be presented in this workshop are: (1) BDCExplorer: web portal to access, visualize and download EO data cubes and extract image times series; (2) TerraCollect: web application to collect and analyze land use and land cover samples, based on satellite image time series; (3) Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) R package for land use and land cover classification using satellite image times series and machine learning; and (4) Web services and R and Python clients. The web services include: (1) Spatio Temporal Asset Catalog (STAC); Web Time Series Service (WTSS) to extract image time series from EO data cubes; (3) Web Land Trajectory Service (WLTS) to extract land use and land cover trajectories from distinct data sets.</abstract>

                <abstract># Cloud Native Geospatial for Earth Observation Workshop

The advent of cloud computing has revolutionised the capabilities of researchers and professionals globally, helping them to access and analyse Earth observation (EO) data more easily than ever. Despite the well-understood tools and technologies, such as cloud-optimised GeoTIFFs and the spatio-temporal asset catalog (STAC) specification, many EO professionals have not yet had the opportunity to practically apply these innovations. This workshop aims to bridge that gap by showcasing how cloud-native geospatial technologies simplify the process of working with EO data, using Python as the primary programming language.

Participants will delve into a real-world case study focused on documenting land productivity metrics, a crucial component for monitoring the UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicators for 15.3.1. The workshop will utilise NASA’s Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel data, accessed through Earthdata, to explore the land productivity metric in depth.

Our workshop hosts, Caitlin Adams and Alex Leith, bring extensive experience from their work on large-scale cloud-native programs such as Digital Earth Africa, Digital Earth Australia, and the recently launched Digital Earth Pacific. These projects leverage petabytes of data to create valuable information products that inform decision-making processes across countries and continents.

                <description>Everybody needs to publish geographic information on the web. There are many platforms already available to support this. Even if we use available commercial on self-hosted platforms, understanding how all the workflows work is important for those aiming to create web map-based applications.

This workshop will fully utilize QGIS + QGIS Server to create web map-based applications. We will use QGIS, QGIS Server, and PostgreSQL.

Projects will be stored on PostgreSQL, on the server side. A database trigger will extract all the necessary information from the project (using PyQGIS) to produce a wonderful web map application. Project layers will be served by QGIS Server. Participants will be able to create QGIS projects and all the same information and customizations will be reflected in the web app.

To have a similar customization on the web, we will go throughout the project to check all layers, all columns properties, all relations, etc to make sure the user will see the same contents on the browser. We will see how QGIS layouts can be used and how users can even add custom content to the printed layouts. Atlas layouts will be used also, to print selected items or search results, for example.

The workshop will use a prepared docker composition with all required software to make it easier for starters. 

All the concepts and configurations will be reviewed and explained. Participants will take full advantage of this workshop if:
- are familiar with QGIS
- have basic Python knowledge (we will use PyQGIS, primarily on the QGIS console, and also outside QGIS console)
- are familiar with docker usage
- able to navigate in a PostgreSQL client, like pgAdmin or DBeaver
- have a basic understanding of how the web works</description>

                <abstract>The goal of this workshop is to explain on a hands-on demo what GraphQL is all about using a spatial database. While showing GraphQL features (including spatial features) we’ll demonstrate how they can be perfectly implemented on top of an existing PostgreSQL/PostGIS spatial database. We’ll discuss pros and cons of this technology over REST, highlighting a few important points in which they differ.

During the workshop we will:

- Learn how to use, create and manage a fully spatial GraphQL API using PostGraphile and a common, existing PostgreSQL/PostGIS spatial database;
- Publish spatial and non-spatial data;
- Create processing/analysis endpoints that rely on PostgreSQL/PostGIS functions;
- Secure the data with Row-Level Security (RLS) set at the database level and transpose those credentials to the API in a straightforward way. Users can then make use of JWT tokens to authenticate.
- Extend the GraphQL API using plugins that can be used to create complex endpoints that need to be created at the server level with NodeJs and Javascript or Typescript.</abstract>

                <description>This workshop will be publicly hosted in GitHub. Using guided steps, we’ll start by exploring the basics of GraphQL. Then, we'll create and configure one existing spatial database using PostGIS. From that point onwards we will slowly increase the complexity and learn step by step how to create and configure a GraphQL API.

The workshop will take 4 hours and requires no previous knowledge of GraphQL. However, It is advisable to have basic knowledge in PostgreSQL and PostGIS.</description>

                <description>GRASS GIS provides numerous tools to process and analyze Earth Observation data. There are modules to search for, download, import and pre-process data from MODIS, Landsat, Sentinel, etc. Furthermore, GRASS offers tools for atmospheric and topographic corrections, quality assessment, cloud and shadow masking, pansharpening, estimation of spectral indices, object based image analysis (OBIA), clustering and classification algorithms, among others.

In this hands-on session we will present and exemplify a subset of the imagery toolsets in combination with other GRASS GIS core modules and addons in a workflow starting from data download to the supervised classification of different scenes and visualization of results. We will specifically go through filtering and downloading data, importing, adding semantic labels, pre-processing, estimation of indices, and image classification. Eventually, the resulting maps will be exported to Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) files for further usage in QGIS, GeoServer, or elsewhere. This workshop will be run in a JupyterLab environment, taking advantage of the latest GRASS GIS Python features for Jupyter.</description>

                <abstract>Ever wonder what GDAL is doing under the hood when you read a GeoTIFF file? Doubly so when the file is a Cloud-optimized GeoTIFF (COG) on a remote server somewhere? Have you been wondering what this new GeoZarr thing is all about and how it actually works? Then there's the whole Kerchunk/VirtualiZarr indexing to get cloud-native access for non-cloud-native data formats, what's that about?

Cloud-native geospatial is all the rage these days, and for good reason. As file sizes grow, layer counts increase, and analytical methods become more complex, the traditional download-to-the-desktop approach is quickly becoming untenable for many applications. It's no surprise then that users are turning to cloud-based tools such as Dask to scale out their analyses, or that traditional tooling is adopting new ways of finding and accessing data from cloud-based sources. But as we transition away from opening whole files to now grabbing ranges of bytes off remote servers it seems all the more important to understand exactly how cloud native data formats actually store data and what tools are doing to access it.

This workshop aims to dig into how cloud-native geospatial data formats are enabling new operational paradigms, with a particular focus on raster data formats. We'll start on the surface by surveying the current cloud-native geospatial landscape to gain an understanding of why cloud native is important and how it is being used, including:

* the core tenets of cloud-native geospatial formats
* cloud-native data formats for both raster and non-raster geospatial data
* SpatioTemporal Asset Catalogs (STAC) and how STAC is used for raster data discovery and access
* high-level tooling like odc-stac that can leverage STAC and Dask to scale processing of cloud-native data

Then we'll get hands-on and go deep to build up an in-depth understanding of how cloud native raster formats work. We'll examine the COG format and read a COG from a cloud source by hand using just Python, selectively extracting data from the image without any geospatial dependencies. We'll repeat the same exercise for geospatial data in Zarr format to see how that compares to our experience with COGs. Lastly we'll turn our attention to Kerchunk/VirtualiZarr to see how these technologies might allow us to optimize data access for non-cloud-native formats.</abstract>

                <title>Community Drone Mapping - Drone Tasking Manager Practical Workshop</title>
                <subtitle />
                <type>Workshop</type>
                <date>2024-12-03T09:00:00-03:00</date>

                <abstract>## Summary
The Drone Tasking Manager (DroneTM) is a suite of tools for communities to use low-cost, safe, accessible drones to collect high-quality aerial imagery and data on the scale of thousands of square kilometers.

## The Problem
Drone imagery and data is useful for mapping, disaster resilience, and a variety of humanitarian, development, and economic activities, but drone mapping tools have not been well-adapted to community use in development and humanitarian contexts—until now. 

While imagery acquisition by local communities using small, lightweight drones is possible, the tools for doing so are mostly proprietary and not well-adapted to local needs. Commercial flight planning applications such as Pix4D Capture, DroneDeploy, Litchi, Dronelink, and similar programs do not work with recently-manufactured low-cost drones, and are not effective for multiple users to coordinate their efforts, making them ineffective for colllecting imagery and data over large areas.

## The Solution
DroneTM, built by HOT and Naxa with support from the World Bank's Caribbean Disaster Risk work, GFDRR, OpenDroneMap.org, and many others, is a Digital Public Good for everyone, but particularly intended to support local communities who don't have budgets for expensive equipment and software. It's Free/Open Source Software made by, with, and for communities.

## The Workshop—Practical Commmunity Drone Operation and Data Acquisition
In Belém, we would like to offer a workshop in which participants will:
- Use the Drone Tasking Manager desktop application to create projects, defining and Area of Interest to cover with multiple drones by multiple teams concurrently.
- Use the DroneTM mobile Web app to create, access, and download individual flight plans for low-cost drones
- Execute short (~15minute) automated drone flights using the DroneTM flight plans (we encourage people to bring their own drones, but we will supply several drones—properly registered and and legal to operate—so that everyone can experience it).
- Process the resulting data into orthophoto images, Digital Elevation Models, and 3D meshes (using OpenDroneMap as part of the DroneTM back end)
- Import the orthophoto images into QGIS for visualization. We won't have time—or scope—to get into use and analysis of the imagery, but people will be able to get it loaded up into a QGIS canvas and ready for use.

## Participant Profile
We hope to welcome participants who are:
- From, working with, or supporting communities with actual needs and/or projects that can benefit from aerial imagery and data. We especially hope to welcome those who have not been able to access drone technology due to barriers related to cost and complexity.
- Interested in testing, supporting, or using drone technology and meeting like-minded folks
- Interested in advocating to regulatory agencies, donors, and other stakeholders to promote inclusive, community-based drone empowerment
- Due to existing inequities in the drone and tech sector, women will be prioritized for hands-on practical flight operations experience

## Participant Requirements
- Owning or bringing a drone is not required. However, any participants with drones _that are legally permitted to fly in Brazil_ are encouraged to bring them, particularly the DJI Mini 4 Pro (other drones are supported, but only the DJI Mini 4 Pro is guaranteed to work at this stage; there will be updates to the list of compatible devices before the workshop).
- Drone piloting experience is not required. We will cover the basics of manual flight, but the DroneTM flights will be automated and supervised by experienced operators.
- Laptops are useful for the project creation module. Those who do not have laptops will be able to follow along on a projector.
- Reasonably decent-spec Android devices are helpful to explore the mobile app.</abstract>

                <title>The relationship between rural credit and deforestation</title>
                <subtitle />
                <type>Oral Presentation 2</type>

                <abstract>Tropical forests host half of Earth’s biodiversity (Dirzo &amp; Raven, 2003), 62% of global terrestrial vertebrate species (Pillay et al., 2022) and play a crucial role as a carbon sink (Mitchard, 2018). Despite their importance, every year, 3 to 4 million hectares of primary tropical forests are lost, mainly in Brazil, Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) (Hansen et al., 2013; Seymour, 2022), contributing to 22% of total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions worldwide (IPCC, 2023).

Preventing deforestation requires understanding its root causes, particularly the capital availability to the farm sector. In many tropical countries, rural credit is available as loans at subsidized interest rates to improve agricultural production or support agricultural costs (Servo, 2019). However, these loans may be leading to more deforestation. Some studies have analyzed this issue on a municipal scale, but few peer-reviewed studies have linked rural credit to individual property-scale deforestation. Recently, the NGO Greenpeace (Greenpeace, 2024) and the Climate Policy Initiative (Mourão et al., 2024) published two studies showing the relationship between rural credit and deforestation. Understanding this relationship can improve public policies to prevent deforestation from happening even before it starts.

2.	Methods
In this study, I used open data and FOSS4G to quantify the amount of Rural Credit released to rural properties that committed Deforestation. The datasets came from different open data sources. The Central Bank of Brazil provides data on rural credit on the SICOR System. The National Institute of Space Research (INPE) provides data on forests and deforestation on the Terrabrasilis system. The Brazilian Forest Service provided data for each property's Rural Environmental Registry (CAR), providing their boundaries. The Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) provides administrative boundaries (state and municipality) data.

Using the Terra library in CRAN-R,. I processed the data sets from three states that contributed the most to deforestation: Rondônia, Mato Grosso and Pará. To check the results, I used a Spatialite database and QGIS desktop. The novelty here is that using R scripts made it possible to rebuild the relational database from SICOR in a geospatial environment, providing a reproducible environment. All steps are described below.

First, using R, all the data needed for the analysis was downloaded from their original source and loaded into the R environment. The second step, still using R, was to recreate the SICOR, CAR and PRODES Deforestation tables and populate them into a Spatialite (SQLite) database. This step provides a valuable tool for monitoring by both environmental agencies and the banks that provide loans for rural credit.

The next step was to intersect the deforestation data with the CAR property boundaries, calculating the amount of deforestation on each property using PRODES data between 2008 and 2023. Next, the total number of loans between 2013 and 2023 was identified for each property. All these steps were processed using the Terra library in R. The results are shown in the table below.

3.	Results
In 1992, the Brazilian Parliament enacted Law 4,829, creating subsidies for rural credit, known as Safra Plan. As a result of this law, the interest rates of the Safra Plan have always been significantly lower than those practiced in the market. In March 2019, for example, while the average interest rate on loans for non-rural purposes stood at 31.6% per year, rural credit was observed at 10.8% p.y. on market rates, and even lower with controlled rates observing an average rate of 6.1% p.y.(Servo, 2019) .

As a result of this accessible credit, I found that from 2013 to 2023,  almost BRL 9 Billion was loaned to properties with some deforestation in these three states (RO, PA, MT). Counting deforestation from August 2008 to July 2023, 37963 km² is the total amount of clearing in properties that received rural credit in those same three states, representing 39% of all deforestation for the period.</abstract>

                <abstract>The field of speleology is dependent upon the accurate mapping and analysis of data to gain an understanding of subterranean environments. Free and open-source software (FOSS) has facilitated advancements in spatial data management, offering robust tools for data collection, analysis, and fieldwork. Software solutions such as PostgreSQL with PostGIS, QGIS, GRASS, and QField facilitate efficient geospatial data management and data collection. The accurate location determination of caves is of paramount importance, given their significant ecological, historical, and cultural value. In Brazil, the implementation of rigorous environmental legislation has resulted in the establishment of a 250-meter buffer zone surrounding caves. This regulatory measure is designed to ensure the protection of these vulnerable ecosystems and to regulate activities within their vicinity. The radius may be modified based on the findings of environmental studies, thereby ensuring the preservation of caves while facilitating socio-economic development. This study presents EspeleoVale, a software as a service (SaaS) solution hosted on AWS. It employs open source scripting languages and frameworks, including AngularJS, PostgreSQL with PostGIS, and MapStore2 integrated with Geoserver, to effectively manage and visualize speleological data for a mining company in Brazil. By employing SQL queries and spatial functions, users can visualize cave locations and their restricted areas, thereby facilitating the assessment of project impacts on these geomorphological features. In this study, examples of visualization and spatial analysis are presented for five hypothetical caves and a hypothetical project, returning intersections, differences and merged areas, which are vital for the environmental protection of cavities and for knowing project restrictions. Thus, the integration of an RDBMS for spatial analysis and FOSS tools for data visualization fosters new developments and promotes more efficient speleology data management.</abstract>

                <abstract>The National Institute of Colonization and Agrarian Reform (INCRA) is a body of the Brazilian federal government, linked to the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Supply (MAPA). Its main mission is to execute national agrarian policy, promoting agrarian reform and land planning in Brazil. INCRA works on several fronts to guarantee territorial regularization, sustainable development and social justice in the countryside.

The Amazon is a strategic region for INCRA due to its unique characteristics and specific challenges. The body works on land regularization to guarantee the legal security of squatters and combat land grabbing, thus contributing to environmental preservation, and thus, favors the control and monitoring of rural properties, helping to combat illegal deforestation and environmental degradation.

For regularization to become a reality, INCRA has signed Decentralized Execution Terms in several Brazilian states. In Rondônia, the partnership was established with the Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Rondônia (IFRO), through TED 20/2021/INCRA-SEDE/IFRO, called GeoRondônia Project. The project aims to serve and document more than 25,000 families and rural properties. To achieve this, the necessary steps are the georeferencing of properties, rural environmental registration and occupational supervision.

The georeferencing of rural properties is a complex process that requires knowledge in surveying, legal aspects, precision and efficiency. With the growing demand for land regularization in Brazil, especially in large areas such as the Amazon, it is essential to seek solutions that reduce costs, automate tasks and ensure data quality. This article presents the productivity gains achieved by the GeoRondônia project, which uses QGIS and the GeoINCRA plugin to automate tasks. The methodology developed involves data validation and quality control, with automation implemented in Python, ensuring accuracy in property certification and the large-scale generation of .ODS spreadsheets (certification document).

This is an innovative methodology, unavailable in any other Geographic Information System, open or private, whose steps were developed to meet the highest technical quality standards for georeferencing projects with large volumes of data, such as in GeoRondônia, which has worked in settlements that have more than 2,000 properties.

Initially, all georeferenced data processing dynamics were carried out manually. In this way, the Space Research Group (GREES/IFRO), together with other collaborators from the Paraíba Institute (IFPB), has supported the project's actions for the development of innovative technology, in order to optimize actions involving certification of rural properties, using free tools.

The biggest challenge of the project is time and qualified labor, therefore, aiming to increase productivity, the Free and Open Source Software Solution was developed, called FOSSS GeoRondônia, which integrates features from QGis and, mainly, the GeoINCRA Plugin . This set of functions enabled temporal gains, professional qualification of employees and finances, as it is completely free, and can -be replicated to any other large data volume project involving georeferencing.

To optimize demands, the main steps of FOSSS GeoRondônia, after adjusting the observations tracked in the field to meet INCRA's positional accuracies, are: a) elimination of topological errors in the geometries of the settlement database; b) elimination of errors when filling in vertices and limits in the settlement database; c) elimination of errors in the name of the property and .ODS spreadsheet; d) generation of .ODS spreadsheets in an automated way and launch in INCRA's Land Management System (SIGEF).

The results obtained with FOSSS GeoRondônia are notable: Process Automation with the assembly of the database with greater security, precision and practicality; Automation in product generation, where ODS spreadsheets that were previously done manually are now generated automatically; Reduction of spreadsheet preparation time by around 70%; Elimination of topological and writing errors, ensuring accurate and consistent data; Cost savings using QGIS and the GeoINCRA plugin, eliminating the need for expensive licenses, allowing for a more efficient allocation of public resources.

Currently, the GeoRondônia Project has already organized the databases for 8 Settlement Projects, which make up around 1,500 properties. A very productive result was the field collection, processing and launch of 3 new Settlements (574 properties) in the state of Rondônia in record time, for launch by the Federal Government, all carried out between April and May 2024.

The processing of georeferenced data on a very high scale, using FOSSS GeoRondônia, allowed the generation of products with precision and the consequent launch in SIGEF with reliability, which can be replicated for any project in Brazil. This has promoted greater efficiency in the services performed, and helped INCRA in meeting the large volume of Agrarian Reform demands, to transform rural settlements into true agents of sustainability and productivity.

Based on this, we are interested in presenting this new functionality to the national and international public present at FOSS4G, and who are looking for free solutions for different demands, in order to promote the dissemination and replication of the use of FOSSS GeoRondônia.</abstract>

                <abstract>The Amazon faces significant logistical challenges due to its size and complex geographical features, such as the dense rainforest and vast hydrographic network. In Brazil, Amazonas stands out for its ecological diversity and difficulties of access, requiring innovative solutions for educational development. The Amazonas Education Media Centre (CEMEAM) uses In-Person Teaching with Technological Mediation (IPTTM) to overcome these obstacles, promoting digital inclusion and democratizing access to education. Implemented in 2007 by the Amazonas State Secretary of Education and School Sports (SEDUC-AM), it combines face-to-face classes with satellite videoconferences and other media, reaching more than 25,000 students in an area of 1,571,000 km². To help with spatial management, CEMEAM was presented with a proposal for a Geographic Information System in a web environment (WebGIS) using free software and plugins (QGIS and QGIS Cloud) as well as freely accessible products. The WebGIS enabled a variety of analyses and proved it could contribute to more efficient spatial management, adapted to regional specificities, such as the isolation of localities and the dependence of students on river transportation. Although it is not yet a formalized institutional tool, SIG Web demonstrates the potential of geotechnologies in educational management in the Amazon, serving as an important experiment to support CEMEAM in its needs.</abstract>

                <abstract>Public participation is of utmost importance for community mobilization and engagement, so that through their networks and relationships, both within and outside the community, they create space through social action. According to Goodchild (2007), there is a demand to generate information that helps vulnerable communities to strengthen relationships with the government responsible for promoting important interventions to bring about change. It is possible to use the sensitivity and ability to inform the needs of each resident, from their perception, and understand the needs of their community. Therefore, it is important to use open and free mapping tools that represent the community's demands, producing information that allows collective autonomy to carry out strategies that involve the public authorities through co-optation and coalitions aimed at community-based interventions (Silva, 2014).

In this sense, OpenStreetMap (OSM) stands out as a tool for collaborative mapping and community interventions in highly vulnerable urban areas, such as favelas. Given OSM's participatory and open nature, it allows the creation of maps with records of features of various kinds, but it is also of great value as a platform for community training and the development of geospatial skills (Bortolini and Camboin 2019).

The objective is to analyze from the literature how OpenStreetMap has been used for training and empowering local actors in projects aimed at community-based interventions in favelas.

A systematic literature review was carried out with the support of artificial intelligence tools (Chat GPT-4, Elicit, Semantic Scholar, Chat pdf), bibliography management software (Zotero), and software for visualizing bibliometric networks (VosViewer) combined with other research methodologies (P.I.C.O., Bardin) to assist in the overall evaluation of the literature. Although AI tools have great power to aid the review, they do not replace the need for critical judgment and human expertise, demanding confidence in the knowledge of the contents and scientific methodology.

The following keywords were used in the platforms of WoS and Scopus collection lists in the first search: [Collaborative mapping, Community intervention, OpenStreetMap, Community empowerment, Community mobilization, Citizen participation]. In this first search, some filters were established, such as the publication date within the last 10 years and articles that were open access. Based on these filters, 43 articles were found that fit these specifications in the Web of Science, with the vast majority in English. From this first literature search, there also arose the need to increase the number of articles that most closely aligned with the theme. The keywords were adjusted based on these articles. In this second search, other databases were also included for the research, such as Scopus and Google Scholar. The use of artificial intelligence tools Elicit and Semantic was essential to find articles using the keywords that were most repeated in the main articles. Still in this second search, these adjusted keywords were entered into Chat-GPT 4 to generate search strings under the acronym P.I.C.O (Population; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome) for use in the Web of Science.

Keywords for the second search: [Collaborative mapping, informal settlements, urban slums, OpenStreetMap, public participation, community engagement, community-based intervention, community intervention].
Final search string: [("Collaborative mapping" OR "participatory mapping") AND ("community intervention" OR "community-based intervention") AND ("OpenStreetMap" OR OSM) AND ("community empowerment" OR "empowerment") AND ("community mobilization" OR "community engagement") AND ("citizen participation" OR "public participation") AND (favelas OR "informal settlements" OR "urban slums")]. Finally, twenty articles were identified in the Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Scopus databases.

Based on these 43 articles, a synthesis framework is being built that aims to systematize information about the works found, informing: 1) Source/Base/Collection, 2) Reference according to ABNT, 3) Name of the Journal, 4) Contact of the main author - email, 5) Country of affiliation of the authors, 6) Country of the mapped community, 7) Problem/Objective/Hypothesis, 8) Methodology, 9) Materials used, 10) Techniques used, 11) Main results, 12) Does it work with Favela? 13) What is the nature of the community-based intervention? 14) Did favela residents operate the OpenStreetMap? 15) Where is the favela and/or intervention? 16) If mapping in a favela, what features and attributes were mapped? 17) Were integrated digital and analog cartographic technologies used? Which ones? 18) Were methods used for community appropriation of cartographic tools and data? 19) Was educational material provided? Indicate link, 19) Was a method for evaluating the tools and processes used implemented? 20) Were community impact indicators used? 21) Are effective impacts felt by the community reported? Which ones?

By constructing this framework, we are evaluating aspects such as the geographic diversity in the use of OSM, indicating the platform's flexibility and adaptability, or the still limited participation of local actors in mapping their communities. By compiling data on the nature of community-based interventions, techniques and methodologies used, and community impact indicators, we aim to identify common patterns in the types of interventions that have been most effective. Furthermore, the analysis of reported impacts can indicate tangible benefits of these projects.

The analysis of how projects addressed training and education, including the provision of educational materials and methods for community appropriation of cartographic tools and data, can indicate strategies used to empower local communities. We are also analyzing the features and attributes mapped specifically in favelas, to identify the main challenges and specific needs of these areas, supporting the indication of demands for improvements in methodologies and mapping tools in these urban contexts.

Thus, we are building a comprehensive framework on the current state of the use of OpenStreetMap for training and intervention in favelas, identifying gaps, challenges, and opportunities for future research and projects.</abstract>

                <abstract>Forest registration is essential for effectively managing natural resources, enabling improved tree management (Kattenborn, Eichel and Fassnacht 2019). This process simplifies urban planning, allowing for a more conscientious approach and significantly contributing to the preservation of green areas. The proposal to reduce environmental impact, survey time, and required effort (Barbosa et al. 2018; Li et al. 2015; Beloiu et al. 2023) has motivated the growing use of computer vision for these tasks. Today, this represents a true cartographic revolution. These innovations enhance the quality of life in cities by providing accurate and up-to-date data to support critical decisions (Barbosa et al. 2018).
This work aims to detect, classify, and georeference trees in urban environments using image segmentation algorithms applied to aerial and street-level images. Several studies use aerial images (Beloiu et al. 2023; Wäldchen and Mäder 2018; Mlenek, Dalla Corte e Santos 2020), but our approach seeks to improve the detection and identification of tree species by combining street-level images with aerial images. Our model will be developed with the algorithms that present the best metrics for species segmentation and classification based on related studies. The project also prioritizes using free and open-source software in its development. This not only democratizes access to robust monitoring and analysis tools but also encourages collaboration and innovation in the geospatial community, aligning with the values of FOSS4G.
We will apply pre-processing techniques to the images to enhance the model’s accuracy, including geometric and atmospheric correction with QGIS software. Gaussian filters will also be applied to reduce noise and contrast adjustments to make edges and textures more distinct. After this step, we will proceed to the feature extraction stage for automatic species identification using a machine-learning model. Given the increasing need for environmental preservation and sustainable management, identifying and classifying tree species have become solid allies for ecological conservation, positively impacting urban quality of life.
To map the urban area of Rio Paranaíba, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) drone equipped with a high-resolution camera was used, capturing images with a 3.5 cm resolution. The UAV was operated autonomously, flying in parallel strips over the city. A 70% overlap between the images was used, resulting in the creation of an accurate orthomosaic of the region, favoring more accurate georeferencing of the trees. OpenStreetMap software was used to create the orthomosaic. GPS performed georeferencing during the flight. Street-level images were obtained with a camera that provides 360º coverage. For species classification, a training dataset was created from samples collected in the field, both aerial and ground-level. Various machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), were researched and evaluated for their accuracy in species classification.
Tree identification through images of trunks and leaves presents significant challenges due to high intraclass variability and high interclass similarity. High intraclass variability refers to the substantial differences between images of trunks or leaves of the same tree species caused by lighting variations, capture angle, and tree condition. On the other hand, high interclass similarity refers to the very similar visual characteristics between different species, making it difficult to distinguish one from another based solely on appearance. Additionally, improper color balance adjustments by cameras can introduce unwanted shades, such as a greenish tint, further complicating accurate classification. These combined factors make using deep learning for tree classification a complex and challenging problem (Cotrim et al. 2019). This technique, which combines remote sensing with aerial and ground-level images and advanced machine learning techniques, is expected to present a significant advance in tree species classification. This approach allows for detailed analysis of trunk and leaf textures, potentially significantly improving species identification accuracy. Studies such as those by Kattenborn, Eichel and Fassnacht (2019) have demonstrated that CNN-based segmentation (U-net) can achieve an 84% accuracy in vegetation classification using high spatial resolution RGB images. The U-net is widely recognized for its effectiveness in image segmentation tasks, especially in high-precision and detail scenarios. Its architecture captures complex features, making it ideal for detecting and classifying specific elements in high-resolution images. Additionally, the U-net has shown consistent results in various remote sensing applications, making it a reliable choice for geospatial data analysis projects. Therefore, adopting the U-net in the project can ensure superior tree species identification and mapping performance. This work aligns closely with the themes addressed at the FOSS4G event, as it demonstrates the practical application of free and open-source software tools in an environmental monitoring context. QGIS, OpenDroneMap, and OpenStreetMap exemplify how open technologies can be integrated to solve complex georeferencing and species classification problems. Furthermore, the focus on urban areas and the combination of drone and street view data provides valuable insights for the geospatial community, showing the feasibility and benefits of free software for urban and environmental applications.</abstract>

                <abstract>This article presents the case of the mapping of the informal settlement Erizo Juan Santamaría. The neighborhood went from being an empty space on digital maps to be part of the official cartography of Costa Rica. The mapping was carried out using technologies based on free/open software and participatory cartography methodologies; the work was done jointly between the people who live in the community and Laboratorio Experimental (LabExp) a research and extension project of the public university Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica. The active participation of the community in the process was key for the Municipal Council of Alajuela, where the neighborhood is located, to make official the traces and names of the streets and alleys of Erizo Juan Santamaría for municipal purposes. Furthermore, at the request of the municipal council, the National Nomenclature Commission approved the names at the national level.

The informality of the Erizo Juan Santamaría neighborhood lies in the fact that the people who live in the space do not own the land. The territory where the neighborhood is located belongs to two public institutions, one part to the Municipality of Alajuela and the other to the National Institute of Housing and Urbanism (INVU). In the 1970s, the first families began to occupy the territory where the settlement is currently located. Since then, the inhabitants of Erizo Juan Santamaría have solved their basic common infrastructure needs, as well as managed access to public services. The two public institutions, owners of the land, as well as the neighboring neighborhoods have assessments and interests in the informal settlement, which are manifested in a tense relationship that includes marginalization, manipulation, stigmatization, and invisibility.

In 2017, LabExp and representatives of the neighborhood agreed to work together on a 4 years university extension project aiming to make the informal settlement visible to decision-making institutions and neighboring neighborhoods through maps. Until then, the neighborhood was not represented on commercial digital maps or on the free OpenStreetMap map. LabExp proposed a work plan based on participatory processes, the use of free software and open geospatial data.

It was determined to prioritize two elements to be mapped, considering the relevance for the community in its relationship with the different decision-making actors. The first was the houses, since INVU was interested in developing a project to improve the neighborhood's housing infrastructure, the institution would carry out a census. Through a number in each house, the map could be linked to the census data. The second were the streets and alleys, with the intention that neighbors improve the way in which they gave their home addresses when requesting services. At all times, OpenStreetMap was considered as the repository where the collected data would be stored. The mapping process was carried out with free and open tools from the OSM ecosystem: OSMTracker to capture GPS data in the field, Fieldpapers to collect data in workshops and conversations with neighbors, JOSM to edit the OSM map and QGIS both to create maps to capture data and to create maps to disseminate the mapping process. The mapping activities and dynamics included: free cartography workshops with students at the local school, field trips and unstructured playful dynamics with children in the neighborhood.

In addition to the mapping, two activities were key to foster a feeling of ownership of the process by the residents of the neighborhood and to disseminate the partial and final results. The first was the production of short videos in order for the community's inhabitants to narrate their reality about infrastructure, show the neighborhood, and describe the relationship with the decision-making institutions, in such a way that they linked these experiences with the process of mapping. The second activity was a voting process to choose names for streets and alleys. Each person in the neighborhood had the opportunity to make name proposals for the mapped transit spaces. Subsequently, the residents of the neighborhood were called to elections. One Sunday morning, each person had the opportunity to express their will, voting for the names of their streets and alleys together.

The mapping process was completed by 2021, Erizo Juan Santamaría appeared on the digital maps. In OSM, the houses were included with their respective numbering according to the needs of the INVU, the streets and alleys with the names selected by the inhabitants, elements of public infrastructure, trees and the proper name of the neighborhood. The community was also represented on other commercial maps. Thanks to the dissemination of the short videos and press releases in the University's and national media, the mapping process of Erizo Juan Santamaría was known to the members of Municipal Council of Alajuela.  The Council dedicated an entire session to heard about the project and agreed to make official the names of the streets and alleys decided in the voting process by the neighbors. In addition, the Council managed to make official the names before the National Nomenclature Commission of the National Geographic Institute.
The case of Erizo Juan Santamaría is a unique example in the country where, through participatory cartography, the production of free geospatial data is contributed to official cartography. The visibility of the neighborhood on digital maps makes it easier for the inhabitants to access services that were previously denied or restricted due to the insecurity that people offering the service felt about visiting the neighborhood, partly due to stigmatization and partly because the location led to an empty space on the digital map. Given the increasing use of digital maps to access services and make decisions, it is important to discuss the right of communities to appear on digital maps.</abstract>

                <title>Urban Cycling: Intelligent Bicycle Sensors for Road Safety and Sustainability</title>

                <abstract>## 1. Introduction
Urban transportation is transforming with a focus on sustainability and smart city initiatives. Cycling, a key element of sustainable urban mobility, needs robust infrastructure and reliable data for growth and integration into city planning. Despite advancements in sensor technology and (geo)data analytics, there is a gap in comprehensive collection and use of cycling-specific environmental, safety, and pathway data.

One major deterrent for citizens using bicycles are the perceived dangers in traffic. Identifying insecure sections is crucial to improving cycling infrastructure. Safe countermeasures can change negative perceptions and promote cycling as a safe and sustainable mode of transport. Traditionally, only actual crashes are included in official data, informing city planning decisions. However, analysing high-risk occurrences like near-miss incidents, which greatly impact the perceived danger, can provide a more accurate understanding of cycling safety.

There already exist a number of projects using different technologies to gather and provide data on bicycle safety and urban mobility, but combining environmental and road safety aspects is unique. Projects examining cyclist safety, particularly dangerously close overtaking manoeuvres, often involve remote data processing with machine learning or human analysis. Using live video or images from bike-mounted smartphones is effective but creates data overhead and privacy concerns. Additionally, microcontroller-based sensing systems can be complex to assemble, requiring technical skills and special equipment.

The objective of this work is to address the aforementioned gap by developing an innovative bicycle sensor system that leverages embedded artificial intelligence (AI) to process sensor data on the device. This approach has the potential to reduce data overhead and address privacy concerns while simultaneously providing actionable insights. Our work has the potential to make significant contributions to traffic and transport planning by providing valuable insights into traffic patterns and road safety concerns using extensive spatial datasets gathered by citizens.

## System Design
At the core of our system is a microcontroller unit (MCU) of the senseBox family. The senseBox is a versatile, open hardware electronics kit specifically designed for citizen science projects and educational initiatives, with an emphasis on environmental monitoring and data collection.

The following environmental sensors are used:
- Temperature &amp; rel. Humidity (HDC1080)
- Particulate Matter (SPS30)
- Acceleration (MPU6050)
- Time-of-Flight (ToF) ranging (VL53L8CX)

Moreover, battery management, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and OLED-Display modules are included for connectivity and user feedback. All parts fit into a custom designed, 3D printed enclosure which is attached to the seat post of a bicycle.

The device is communicating with an open source smartphone app using BLE which receives sensor data and combines them with geolocation data. Datasets are recorded and saved on the smartphone, but can also be uploaded to openSenseMap as open data during the ride. Users can control levels of privacy (e.g. by setting privacy zones) to foster digital sovereignty. 

## 2.1. Machine Learning on the Bike
We are introducing two approaches to utilise machine learning capabilities using Tensorflow Lite on the sensor device: overtaking detection and road surface / quality classification. By processing the data directly on the device instead of sending it to larger servers, bandwidth and energy consumption is kept minimal.
In the low resolution depth images recorded by the 8x8 multizone ranging ToF sensor, overtaking vehicles can be detected using shallow neural networks. This has already been described and implemented as a standalone solution in (Scharf et al., 2024), but for integrating it into the mobile sensor system some considerations for available processing capacities, suitable inference times and necessary accuracies will be addressed as part of this work. 
To classify the road surface and its quality, the acceleration sensor will be used. While raw acceleration values can identify the roughness of a road, surface classifications and quality estimations can reveal deviations from intended surfaces to actual surfaces. Using acceleration values and geolocation data, we will explore training a machine learning model using OpenStreetMap Surface information as ground truth data.

## 3. Workshops
Engaging citizens in data collection, problem identification, and the construction of sensor stations empowers them and fosters the generation of new ideas. Our solution is a solder-free, easy-to-assemble mobile sensor device. We conduct a workshop in São Paulo, Brazil, where 20 participants build and mount their own mobile sensor device on bicycles. Afterwards, they collect environmental and bicycle-specific sensor data. Follow-up workshops in Münster, Germany will allow the comparison of the contrasting bicycle infrastructures in these cities, as well as the general urban environment differences, and will provide valuable data and insights into participants' perceptions.
This collaborative effort enhances participants' understanding of scientific methods and urban mobility challenges while ensuring that the collected data reflects cyclists' authentic experiences. By involving citizens as active contributors, we aim to bridge the gap between scientific research and community needs, fostering a more inclusive and participatory approach to urban mobility solutions.
After the workshops we conduct user studies with the workshop participants on the following topics:
Usability: Through surveys at the end of each session and interviews, participants provide feedback on assembling, mounting and connecting the bicycle sensor device. 
Trust in Data: Participants review the data of their recorded dangerous takeovers and road surface types and compare its accuracy with their own perceptions.

## 4. Conclusion and Future Work
This comprehensive evaluation aims to provide a thorough understanding of both the user experience and the technical performance of the system, ultimately guiding the data-driven foundation for improvements in urban mobility solutions. Insights gained from this work will inform future iterations of the project, ensuring the system collects high-quality data and meets the needs of cyclists, thereby effectively enhancing urban mobility and road safety not only for cyclists but for all users of the urban mobility system. Future works will include the development of an open source bike-related data analysis platform as a recommender system for bike infrastructure measures in cities.</abstract>

                <abstract>With the increasing presence of spatialized data and information
in people's daily lives, the constant need to make data-driven
decisions, and the expansion of artificial intelligence
technologies in society, this work seeks a technological solution
focused on simplifying geospatial analyses. The goal is to
democratize access to and understanding of these resources for
common users without the need for advanced knowledge of the
specific geographic information tools currently most used.
To this end, a system was developed that transforms natural
language questions directly into SQL queries, specifically using
PostgreSQL/PostGIS (Li and Jagadish, 2014; Ramsey, 2007).
This system is based on a chat model built on Gemini, which
interprets user queries and generates the corresponding SQL
queries. The back-end API executes these queries and returns the
results, which are visualized in an intuitive and interactive
graphical interface. This allows for dynamic exploration of
geospatial data, facilitating the analysis and visualization of
complex information without the need for advanced technical
knowledge in SQL. The integration of natural language
processing (NLP) and geospatial database queries represents a
significant innovation. This system reduces the learning curve
associated with traditional GIS tools, making the technology
accessible to a broader audience (Craglia et al., 2012). By using
the Gemini model, the system can understand and process a wide
range of natural language inputs, translating them into precise
SQL queries that interact with the geospatial database.
To demonstrate the system's effectiveness, a case study was
conducted using a database composed of 20 tables containing
data released by the National Water Agency (ANA), the Brazilian
Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), and the Energy
Research Company (EPE), which were adjusted for reading by
the system. This database includes a data dictionary that provides
detailed information on what each value represents and its
corresponding context.
The results were evaluated based on the accuracy of answers
given to 192 questions posed within the context of the case study.
Out of these 192 questions, 167 answers were correct, yielding
an accuracy rate of 87% in the total evaluated, allowing detailed
visualization of the geometries and information required by the
user's query in the developed interface. Enhanced accessibility
for non-technical users is one of the most significant benefits
identified in this work, as there is no need for in-depth technical
knowledge in spatial data filters, in addition to the reduced query
time and the ability to generate valuable insights from these data
sets.
This work also highlights the importance of an intuitive and
interactive graphical interface system. The interface allows the
visualization of layers and tables resulting from the query,
enabling users to dynamically explore, filter, and manipulate the
data according to their needs, and obtain insights that would be
difficult to achieve without advanced knowledge of GIS tools (Li
and Wang, 2013).
It is important to note that this work represents a first step in an
initiative for this technological solution model implementing
Artificial Intelligence, from which it was possible to identify
several points of improvement not only in the model but also in
the databases and their construction and acquisition process. The
case study demonstrated that the system can accurately interpret
and execute user queries, providing reliable and relevant results.
With this approach, new possibilities are opened for the
exploration and analysis of geospatial data, enhancing decisionmaking based on information obtained from various areas such
as environmental monitoring, urban planning, and territorial
planning. Future work should focus on improving the system's
capabilities, expanding its application domains, and exploring
new ways to integrate emerging technologies, continuing to drive
innovation in this critical area.</abstract>

                <abstract>Semantic interoperability is essential for integrating open geospatial collaborative and official data. While geosemantics has long been a topic of discussion, recent research has explored automated semantic integration without fully leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in artificial intelligence. This study investigates using chatGPT-4 to semantically associate OpenStreetMap (OSM) tags with the Brazilian topographic mapping model, the Technical Specification for Structuring Vector Geospatial Data (ET-EDGV). Focusing on five classes within the buildings category, the study tested three data structuring methods: spreadsheets, OWL ontology, and XML. Results indicated that ontology and XML formats produced more accurate semantic associations than spreadsheets, with OWL yielding the most coherent results. These findings underscore the importance of properly structured data to capture hierarchical relationships between concepts better. The study also noted the need for precise and detailed queries, highlighting some limitations in chatGPT's ability to understand complex geospatial model inputs. Further research is recommended to enhance LLMs' potential in facilitating semantic interoperability and to explore the role of prompt engineering in optimizing these interactions.</abstract>

                <abstract>Most historical sources, available in multiple formats (e.g., tabular and analog data), contain valuable geographic information. This data can be transformed to generate both quantitative and qualitative insights, enabling the creation of digital maps and unlocking significant potential for scientific analysis. However, the use of historical data presents several challenges: 1. Sources need to be digitized; 2. Collections are often spread across multiple archives; 3. Metadata is often unavailable; 4. Standardizing diverse sources and quantitatively reconstructing data from various periods is difficult; 5. The reliability of historical data can be uncertain; 6. There is limited spatial resolution; and 7. Inaccuracies and text legibility issues are common. These challenges underscore the need for novel methodologies aimed at enhancing the quality and quantity of such sources. This paper presents the findings of the exploratory project AgroecoDecipher (2022.09372.PTDC) dedicated to extracting a comprehensive database from historical textual records and analogue map files to trace agroecological patterns. Employing an exploratory methodology grounded in artificial intelligence (AI) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), the projected solutions include the establish-ment of routines based on AI tools that combines GIS, machine learning (ML), and Large Language Models (LLMs). Approxi-mately 271 survey books from the 1950s were digitized at the municipal level, with a total sheet count exceeding 42,000. Addi-tionally, more than 100 analogue maps were digitized, processed, and vectorized, resulting in a detailed geodatabase map ar-chive. The results are promising and demonstrate that the integration of AI and geospatial tools has proven essential in trans-forming raw historical data.</abstract>

                <abstract>Innovations, such as voice recognition and natural language processing (NLP), have significantly impacted various fields by enabling more natural interactions between humans and machines (Mahmoudi et al., 2023). In geoinformatics, these advances are crucial for visualising geospatial data, allowing the creation of interactive and dynamic maps (Craglia et al., 2012). Online mapping applications, like OpenStreetMap (OSM), have democratised spatial information by enabling public participation in its creation and maintenance (Haklay, 2010). Geolocation is essential in contemporary applications, such as navigation, emergency services, and location-based services. Google Colaboratory (or Colab) Notebook Environment stands out in promoting open science due to its accessibility, ease of use, and collaborative capabilities, and enabling the embodiment of the FAIR principles (Camara et al., 2021). This study aims to develop a voice interaction application in Google Colab Notebook Environment to answer the question: "Is it possible to develop a voice command application for geolocation and visualisation of geospatial data within the Google Colab environment?" The methodology includes FOSS libraries and tools such as geopy, speech_recognition, ffmpeg, librosa, and flask, subdivided into six stages: Audio Data Acquisition, Audio Processing, Speech Recognition, Geocoding, Visualization, and Interface Development. The complete code, under an open license, and how to reproduce this work are available on GitHub. Audio capture is performed using the Web Speech API in JavaScript (JS), which allows real-time voice recognition and integration with the MediaDevices API to access the user's microphone. This method provides an interface for high-quality audio recording, essential for speech recognition and geocoding accuracy. Audio processing involves converting the ".webm" format to ".wav" using ffmpeg, efficiently maintaining the original audio quality. The Librosa library loads the audio, adjusts the sampling rate, and extracts relevant features from the audio signal, such as spectrograms (Bisong, 2019). Speech recognition is performed with the SpeechRecognition library in Python, which provides an interface for various speech recognition services, including the Google Web Speech API. This choice is due to its high accuracy and support for multiple languages, ensuring the system's flexibility and accessibility to a diverse audience (Nassif et al., 2019). Geocoding transforms textual descriptions of locations into geographic coordinates, allowing the visual representation of these locations on an interactive map. The geopy library and the Nominatim service from OSM are used to convert addresses into latitude and longitude coordinates (Mooney &amp; Corcoran, 2012). For the visualisation of geocoded data, a web server was implemented using Flask, a microframework for Python that allows the creation of lightweight and efficient web applications. The user interface was developed with HTML, CSS, and JS, providing an intuitive and interactive experience. The results show that the user and machine interaction occurred satisfactorily. The first message displayed to the user instructs them to slowly state the name of the city, state, or country they wish to geolocate. The use of JS and the Web Speech API allowed the system to detect specific voice commands to start and stop recording, as indicated by the interface colors and states. This step is crucial for subsequent steps to ensure that the captured audio is clear and understandable. When the start command is recognised, the interface changes to indicate that the recording is in progress. The message "Command recognised: starting recording" confirms that the command was detected correctly. If the voice command is not recognised, the interface displays a message asking the user to repeat the command. After recording, the audio is saved in ".webm" format. If a previous audio file exists, it is automatically overwritten. This approach simplifies file management and avoids the accumulation of unnecessary data. Next, the audio is converted to ".wav" format using the ffmpeg library. Then, the audio is transcribed using the Web Speech API and the SpeechRecognition interface for the recognised language, along with the confirmation of the geocoded location and its respective latitude and longitude. The visual feedback proved essential for the user to confirm that the entered information was recognised, improving the system's usability. The displayed information includes city, region, country, latitude, and longitude. The interactive map allows the user to visualise and interact with the located area, altering the zoom level and receiving a voice message informing the map's current zoom level. This work presented the integration of tools that assist in advances in human-computer interaction in geoinformatics, offering an intuitive and accessible interface for users of different technical proficiency levels. The results confirm the feasibility of voice command geolocation in Google Colab, a platform that can be used for education, research, collaboration, and sharing in science, enabling this work's reproducibility. Future research can improve voice interaction features, explore geolocation methods such as bounding boxes, and reduce dependence on JS and Flask. Improving the requirements for peripheral devices could further increase the system's accuracy, accessibility and user experience. The importance of geospatial accessibility lies in enhancing service provision, urban planning, and social inclusion, facilitating mobility for people with disabilities, and improving urban infrastructure (Han et al., 2020).</abstract>

                <abstract>Application-oriented research projects often involve diverse consortium members, from universities to research institutions, to authorities, to domain end users. This requires the integration of very heterogeneous data sources, the facilitation of their combined processing, and the presentation of the results in adequate ways. The challenge here is not only the technical realisation itself, but maybe even more to design solutions catering to this wide user group, balancing feature-richness with easy usability. Data is abundant, and processing plentiful, but it all needs to go the last mile to the final user.

One such research project is “AgriSens DEMMIN 4.0”, which is advancing remote sensing for the digitalisation in agricultural crop production. Thus, the user group includes programmers, domain scientists, as well as farmers. Until now, agriculture is not yet widely taking advantage of EO products. Therefore, the project not only addresses the creation of novel remote-sensing-based application techniques and their implementation, but puts an equally distinct emphasis on the development of an accompanying data integration and visualisation system. In this work, we describe how our architecture – consisting of several pieces of free and open source geo software – closes the gap between data providers and information consumers as it facilitates necessary analysis steps and combines these with adequate presentation to decision makers.

In our IT architecture, we utilise one central datacube to conquer this problem, which acts as a cloud-based geospatial data holding and computation platform. It gathers a multitude of data, ranging from optical and radar raster imagery through weather data to in-situ field measurements, and pre-processes it into an interoperable, analysis-ready state. These resources can then be accessed through APIs for external usage, or computations can be carried out directly on the datacube and the results immediately visualised with tools hosted on the same server.

The whole system is located at the Leibniz Supercomputing Centre of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities (LRZ). Apart from utilising the computing resources available there, this also opens up synergies with already-existing projects: We can make use of the enormous amount of EO data that is already available within the LRZ’s “Data Science Storage” and the DLR’s “terrabyte” platform. These storages are directly mounted into our server so that the datacube can access petabytes of imagery without having to duplicate it again, saving costs and emissions.

At the core of our infrastructure is an instance of the “Open Data Cube” (ODC) software package. Metadata is ingested into its PostgreSQL database and can be retrieved via the built-in web-based data discovery application “ODC Explorer” or via an API endpoint of the emergent STAC standard (which in turn can be accessed via the “STAC Browser” web application or any other compatible software). All raster data is provided in the Cloud-Optimised GeoTIFF (COG) format, allowing efficient access even from remote machines.

Our main interface for scientific computation is Jupyter Hub, enabling collaborative work across institutions. For each user, a dedicated Jupyter Lab instance is spawned in its own Docker container that can access all the data of the previously mentioned storages and has a certain amount of computing resources allocated to it. Users can write their code in Python or R, arguably the most popular programming languages in the EO community, which offer straightforward packages for connecting to an ODC, namely “datacube” and “odcR”. This way, scientists receive the typical professional online analysis environment in which they can work closely to the data and use all the powers of these programming languages and their EO-friendly ecosystem.

Another option to work with the data is via openEO, the new standardised way to interact with big EO data cloud processing backends. We incorporate this standard by utilising the “openEO Spring Driver”, an adapter to translate user-submitted openEO process graphs into analysis code that can be run using ODC. For compatibility with legacy software, it is also possible to request rendered images of pre-configured analysis algorithms via WMS, which are being served by an instance of the powerful “datacube-ows” package.

The final goal, however, is to connect farmers and other end users to these results, who cannot or do not want to deal with complex interfaces. Therefore, these highly technical tools are not sufficient, but need to be accompanied by easy-to-use graphical interfaces. Drawing on the possibilities of modern web technologies, we realise these through purpose-built web apps. Arranged around an OpenLayers-powered map component, data products are streamed in COG format from the datacube and displayed along with the needed additional tooling for interpretation. For example, in this fashion we realised a demonstrator showcasing the results of a water balance model for irrigated potato fields.

Another outlet of the project is the “FieldMApp”, a mobile application designed to be used by farmers both in the field as well as in the office to digitise and monitor areas of lower yield within crop fields. For evaluating plant vitality, a vegetation-index-based raster product is calculated on the datacube using the latest Sentinel-2 imagery and long-term crop-specific averages. Due to the tablet application being programmed with the platform-agnostic Flutter framework, but its standard mapping component not yet supporting COGs, it was necessary to resort to WMS for serving the raster data. As mentioned above, this is comfortably possible by configuring “datacube-ows” on top of ODC.

Overall, the challenge of interoperating various data supplies, processing chains and custom-tailored interfaces – as typically encountered in interdisciplinary research projects – requires complex solutions, but can be achieved quite well by utilising a datacube approach with free and open source geo software building blocks. Our integrated system successfully demonstrates such a use case for the domain of remote sensing in agriculture.</abstract>

                <abstract>3D modeling involves the three-dimensional representation of characters or scenes, providing a greater visualization of details for the object being represented, creating the concept of depth. This concept also opens up a vast array of applications that a simple 2D drawing would be unable to present. This type of representation is widely used in various fields, such as the entertainment industry (e.g., films and games), automotive engineering, architecture/engineering, etc., having diverse purposes and applications. 3D modeling can be achieved through different methodologies, with the primary distinction between them being the intended use of the modeled object. Notable methodologies include Box Modeling, Digital Sculpting, and Poly-by-Poly modeling.
Traditionally, Photogrammetry was defined as the 'science and art of obtaining reliable measurements through photographs' (American Society of Photogrammetry). Although it is a powerful technique for environmental detail formation, there is inherent complexity in its equipment, including both hardware and software, with a significant cost associated with its acquisition and the necessity for specialized knowledge for effective use by its operators. However, with technological advancements, the availability of higher processing capacity equipment at lower costs and more user-friendly software has facilitated wider dissemination and use among a larger number of users. Among these technologies, the introduction of drones into the technical and professional market, with new forms of application and use of photography, has spurred new growth in the use of photogrammetry across various professional sectors and the development of techniques for processing small-format images.
Thus, 3D modeling through photogrammetry allows for the acquisition of large-scale data, enabling detailed studies, sometimes at centimeter or even millimeter scales, with a level of detail that would previously have been impossible or impractical. This contributes positively to feasibility studies, risk analysis, project presentation, among other applications in various fields such as Civil Engineering, Architecture, and Surveying. The combination of these technologies not only enhances project visualization but also amplifies the collection of geospatial data, promoting a more comprehensive and precise approach.
Virtual Reality (VR) is a technology that creates a simulated environment through electronic devices, thereby providing users with a new way of visualization, whether applied to video games or integrated with other fields. The combination of this technology with models obtained from photogrammetry provides realistic environments with impressive detail richness.
This study will address 3D modeling through the close-range technique, using terrestrial photographs. The research is divided into four stages. The first three stages involve processing these images using various types of hardware and software. For the hardware, both processing power and image capture quality are considered, aiming to demonstrate the best possible results at a low cost. Regarding software, the use of open-source programs from various developers was explored, with the intention of making comparisons and achieving the best results among them.
In the fourth and final stage of the research, a market evaluation will be conducted to understand the needs of professionals in the field concerning this technology. To carry out the work, photographs were initially taken with a Canon EOS 200D of the building housing the Graduate Program in Modeling (PPGM) at the State University of Feira de Santana (UEFS). Subsequently, additional images were obtained using other capture equipment, such as mobile phones, following the same research line. A total of 100 photos were collected and processed using three open-source software programs: Meshroom, Colmap, and Regard3D, which are noted for their prominence and positive recommendations among free software options.
The goal was to calibrate parameters to achieve the best possible model, considering software and hardware limitations. With the obtained results, a comparison was made to determine which software offered the best outcome, combining modeling quality, ease of post-processing, and compatibility with the graphics engine (Engine) that will be used for creating the realistic environment. This engine is called Unreal Engine, developed by Epic Games, widely used in video game development but with significant potential for application in fields such as Civil Engineering, Architecture, and Surveying.
Thus, the research could delve into the combination of modeling obtained from photogrammetry with virtual reality. One of the software programs used, which demonstrated good performance, was Regard3D, designed for creating 3D models from two-dimensional images. A machine with low processing hardware was used specifically to compare these results with those from more modern computers. The configuration used is as follows:
•	Processor: Intel Pentium G620
•	Motherboard: DXH61Z M2 Duex
•	Graphics Card: RX580 8GB MingZhou
•	RAM: 16GB
Parameter selection was carried out iteratively in successive stages to improve processing quality. It was observed that processing times were high, particularly in specific stages such as mesh computation. During this process, the software analyzes the provided images to find correspondences, known as interest points, which are distinct and uniquely characterized points in the images. For the various software programs, the most commonly used algorithms for point detection are SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) (Lowe, 1999) and ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) (Ethan Rublee et al., 2011), describing them as characteristic vectors for finding common points between images. After detection, filtering is performed to discard points that are misaligned relative to others.
Additionally, significant time was observed in the densification process, which involves increasing the number of points in a 3D model to add more interest points for better image quality. Various techniques are used in this process, with interpolation being particularly noteworthy, as it uses the characteristics of nearby points to estimate geometry and generate additional points.
Using minimal parameters, the model generation time was extended on this computer configuration, with high RAM usage. Significant storage was required, as the models increased in size at each processing stage, reaching approximately 20GB in the final stage. However, the results were satisfactory compared to the available paid software on the market. Therefore, the use of photogrammetry-generated models, combined with virtual reality to create realistic virtual environments, can be considered positive, with low cost and using free open-source software.</abstract>

                <abstract>1. Introduction &amp; Related Work
Pedestrian mobility is crucial in urban environments, and its promotion can contribute to the achievement of many UN SDGs (Adriazola-Steil et al., 2021). Mapping, which enables public scrutiny and long-term optimized planning, is indispensable in this context. 
With the widespread availability of a large set of Open Street-Level Imagery, such as Mapillary, there is now a significant opportunity that presents significant challenges for data extraction (Ma et al., 2019). The richness of detail in these urban landscape representations can help us better understand the peculiarities of urban environments.  The scope of this project is to make use of them for the study of pathways, focusing in particular on the verification of their existence, their categorization (road, sidewalk, or general footpath), and the identification of their surface material. Since pedestrian crossings are part of the car and pedestrian network, and road characteristics (such as material and width) significantly impact pedestrian safety, it is worth noting that the study of roads is also fundamental to pedestrian infrastructure (Mesfin &amp; Denbi, 2022). However, the central aspect remains sidewalks, often the most ubiquitous type of pedestrian thoroughfare (Kim, 2019), a valuable space for sociability (Osman, 2016), whose "health" is symptomatic of how pedestrian-friendly the city is (Mesfin &amp; Denbi, 2022).  
Despite the importance of knowledge about them for understanding the urban environment, pavements are often poorly mapped (Vestena et al., 2023). Even fewer works delve into the problem of pathway surface identification: Zhou et al. (2023) used conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to identify pavement classes limited to asphalt, gravel, and cement; Zhang et al. (2022) used a similar approach to identify asphalt-only damage such as "potholes" and "patches"; only Mesquita et al. (2022) and Hosseini et al. (2022) made pixel-level identification, albeit the first one was limited to only "paved" and "unpaved" categorization, while the second one notwithstanding having a more wholesome approach has its categorization focused on a New-York centered classes and only classifies sidewalks. There is still a gap in approaches considering standardized surface types and generalized path detection.
2. The Framework
	We propose the Deep Pavements Framework to address these issues. It is a modular project, with each part contributing to the solution of the different challenges. The first module is the Surface-patches Dataset, labeled following the OpenStreetMap surface=* tags standard, supporting the categories of "asphalt", "cobblestone", "compacted", "concrete plates", "concrete", "grass", "gravel", "ground", "paving stones", and "sett" currently, The second module is the Runner, to process the data for a given region. The third is the Sample-picker, which generates random samples for dataset generation. There is also the Sample-labeler to label samples interactively and a central module to guide the potential user into the project's usage. Each module relies upon a different set of dependencies, thus reducing runtime issues. It is important to highlight the primary usage of containerizing engines, i.e., Docker.
Beyond modularity, Deep Pavements has as core design principles: 1) complete openness, meaning that all its dependencies must have a broadly permissive license that enables even for commercial usage; 2) the ease of reproducibility by a straightforward setup with an as such and well-documented, command line interface (CLI); 3) evolvability, the State-of-The-Art (SOTA) algorithms are constantly changing, then at each new release of runner/sample-picker images a new set of tools can be employed while keeping the same CLI; nevertheless the user would still be able to use a previous release; 4) Standard-anchored with classes that had been agreed upon by the broad crowd-sourced knowledge base constituted by OSM community (Rahmig &amp; Kludge, 2013; Mooney &amp; Minghini, 2017). 
The implementation of the main modules (Runner/Sample Picker) uses open-vocabulary AI algorithms to perform the data extraction, following this workflow: 1) Grounding Dino (Liu et al., 2023) based on a free-input, detects the bounding box of the detections; 2) Segment Anything (Kirillov et al., 2023) transforms it into a mask;  3) 3 different versions of the CLIP algorithm (Radford et al., 2021) tests if the detection is not a hallucination; 4) If confirmed, a specialized version of CLIP is used for finally check the surface material using the cheaply clipped biggest rectangle in the detection, assuring the usage of the patch whose texture got less hindered by the effects of perspective (Lederman &amp; Klatzky, 1995) being no-data pixels, free, which is another potential source for classification jeopardy (Kang et al., 2019). 
The workflow results from experiments for the presented design mainly point out the need for hallucination testing. This procedure acts as a shield for one of the main drawbacks of open vocabulary algorithms (Ben-Kish et al., 2024). The use of this particular type of algorithm was essential due to its flexibility (Wang et al., 2024) and the potential for better semantic understanding of the scene due to its embedded language model (Eichstaedt et al., 2021). There is also the possibility of allowing the user to opt out of some or all of OSM standardized classes, which can be helpful in some scenarios with regional uniqueness.  
3. Final Remarks
Deep Pavements is an innovative and comprehensive toolset under continuous development with all modules maintained at Github, with the central module available at  &lt;https://github.com/kauevestena/deep_pavements_project&gt;. The framework enables creating pavement data that is seamlessly plugable into OSM.
 	As future challenges, we plan to filter lousy quality images that can happen on the primary data source (Ma et al., 2019) to detect other visually-identifiable pavement traits such as its decay, standardizing with OSM tags such as smoothness=*; to integrate photogrammetric tools for obtaining additional modeling of pavements, having as main interest in measuring pavement width, one of the most relevant info for accessibility assessment (Kim et al., 2011).</abstract>

                <abstract>With the advancement of technologies applied to Global Navigation Satellite Systems and the popularization of Remotely Piloted Aircraft, aerial photogrammetry has experienced significant advances, especially in geographic and environmental research. Drones equipped with high-resolution sensors have revolutionized data collection, essential for topographic mapping and vegetation analysis. However, many technologies for digital processing and spatial analysis of original images are proprietary and expensive, making access difficult for institutions and researchers, especially in Brazil. This scenario makes free and open-source software, such as WebODM, an important alternative to democratize access to high-quality tools. In view of this, this article analyzes the applicability of WebODM in academic works, through bibliometric analysis in scientific repositories. The search included variations in the software nomenclature and the data were analyzed quantitatively. The Elsevier and Scopus databases led with 59 and 39 publications, respectively, while the national Scielo Brasil database had only one article hosted. There has been a gradual increase in the number of publications involving WebODM since 2016, with a peak of 38 papers in 2023. In comparison, the term "Agisoft Metashape", a proprietary solution for digital aerial photogrammetric processing, returned 1,595 publications in the same search portals. As an initial contribution to the understanding of the state of the art, it was observed that the thematic axes involving remote sensing, photogrammetry, precision agriculture and agricultural management were those that concentrated the largest number of scientific productions on WebODM in the investigated period, exceeding 30 papers. It is concluded that WebODM has stood out as a relevant tool in scientific research, especially for the processing of images derived from drones. Future studies should qualitatively evaluate the results obtained with the use of WebODM in comparison with proprietary software.</abstract>

                <abstract>Standards in the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) domain are crucial for ensuring interoperability, data consistency, and efficiency across diverse applications and platforms. As in other domains, they are necessary to ensure that different GIS software can work together. Moreover, the continuous improvement and development of these standards are essential to keep pace with evolving technologies and user requirements, enhancing the overall functionality and usability of GIS. By adhering to and advancing these standards, the GIS community can foster innovation, support informed decision-making, and address complex geospatial challenges more effectively.
Therefore it’s important to be conservative, using widely supported standards, but also open to emerging technologies, preparing for the future global leap, and welcoming it proactively. The design of the eMOTIONAL Cities Spatial data infrastructure (SDI) is built around this approach   (Simoes, J., and Cerciello, A. (2022). Serving Geospatial Data Using Modern and Legacy Standards: a Case Study from the Urban Health Domain. The International Archives of Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences, 48, 419-425)

The environment we live in affects our mental health and well-being. ​​The eMOTIONAL Cities project has set out to understand how the natural and built environment can shape the feelings and emotions of those who experience it. It does so with a cross-disciplinary and data driven approach, which resulted in numerous datasets from more “traditional” GIS based fields like Urban Planning, as well as other fields like Neuroscience. The common denominator between all these datasets is the geospatial dimension. One of the main goals of the project is to assemble these disparate datasets in a common SDI, in order to enable scientists and eventually the general public, to discover and access the data for the purposes of analysis and decision making.
The OGC API is a family of modern Standards from the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), which leverage modern web technologies like OpenAPI, REST and JSON (Percivall, G. (2017) OGC® Open Geospatial APIs - White Paper). Although very appealing to web developers, they are relatively new compared to the OGC Web Services (OWS) like WFS, WMS or WMTS, which have been in the GIS domain for more than twenty years. When we started the project, we were unsure if it would be possible to set up an SDI, purely based on OGC API, both because of the maturity of the Standards and the availability and Technology Readiness Level (TLR) of implementations. This has led us to initially create an SDI that contains both a modern and legacy stack (Simoes, J., and Cerciello, A. (2022). Serving Geospatial Data Using Modern and Legacy Standards: a Case Study from the Urban Health Domain. The International Archives of Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences, 48, 419-425). However, in the past two years we have seen huge developments in OGC API Standards, with many Standards having parts approved and implementations catching up on those developments. One implementation in particular, pygeoapi (https://pygeoapi.io/), is exemplar in terms of the Standards development process, by participating actively in the OGC Code Sprints, by being an Early Implementer (EI) and even a Reference Implementation (RI) of several OGC API Standards. It embodies the new OGC paradigm, where the development of the Standard goes hand in hand with the development of implementations, resulting in published Standards which are market ready.
The eMOTIONAL Cities SDI demonstrates that it is now possible to share geospatial data using OGC API with Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). We have selected Standards to enable the publication of feature data (OGC API - Features), tiles of geospatial information (OGC API - Tiles), sensor data (SensorThings API) and metadata (OGC API - Records). Although that was not the case when we started this work, they are now all approved Standards. The SDI uses a stack of FOSS software, with pygeoapi at its core and several supporting services. In order to ease the deployment and reproducibility of the system, the services were virtualized into docker containers and orchestrated using docker-compose. This resulted in a system that is infrastructure agnostic and can be deployed in any Cloud Service Provider (CSP) in a matter of minutes. The code is available on GitHub with an MIT license (https://github.com/emotional-cities/openapi-sdi) and released in Zenodo with DOI 10.5281/zenodo.6591179. We have also set up pipelines to enable both humans and machines to ingest data and metadata into the SDI and extensive documentation about how to access the SDI, using clients such as QGIS, MapStore or jupyter notebooks.
The SDI is live at: http://emotional.byteroad.net/ and it includes 97 datasets from five different cities (e.g.: Lisbon, London, Copenhagen, Tartu and Lansing). It has collections that characterize the physical environment (e.g.: Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), Annual mean NO2 concentration), the built environment (e.g.: Buildings with repair needs ratio, Average age of buildings) socio-economic aspects (e.g.: Area Deprivation Index, Number of People Travel by Bicycle to Work) and health data (e.g.: Crude percent of adults with depression, Mortality rate), as well as results of experiments (e.g.: London outdoor walk test data: Air Quality Temperature, London outdoor walk test data: Sound Pressure levels). The data can be discovered and queried in the OGC API - Records searchable catalog: https://emotional.byteroad.net/catalogue
In this article we would like to share our journey during the process of implementing the SDI, and how we navigated the technological and human challenges of adopting emerging technologies in constant development. We hope the results of this project can encourage scientists, urban planners and other experts who deal with geospatial data in some way, to embark on a similar journey and contribute towards making geospatial information FAIR; e.g.: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. At the same time, we hope to promote a family of GIS standards (e.g.: OGC API) that seeks to mitigate the learning curve that has always characterized them.</abstract>

                <abstract>OGC Standards and OSGeo Projects have been widely applied to different kinds of geospatial data and extended for the implementation of geospatial data science environments. However, there’s no review comprehensively summarising and discussing the progress of these open source technologies for publishing geospatial databases on the Web. The proposed Systematic Technology Review is a stylized version of the Systematic Literature Review, covering the documentation of OGC Standards and OSGeo Projects. The search strategy consisted of screening OGC and OSGeo websites for the latest version of OGC Standards' implementation (or community) specification and OSGeo Projects' developers manual. This review considered the technologies published until June 2024. A total of 80 OGC Standards and 52 OSGeo Projects were identified. To recognize the main topics of each technology in detail, the documentation was analysed by Latent Dirichlet Allocation - LDA using the Scikit-learn package in Python. Grid-search was used to find the optimal hyperparameters for the number of components and the decay of the learning rate. With the maximum number of iterations set to 100, the best model was obtained with 8 components and 0.1 learning decay. Then, the most probable topic was predicted for each documentation. The network of similarities arising from LDA was exported to Gephi for visualisation, where ForceAtlas2 layout algorithm was used to create a weighted undirected graph, keeping only edges with weight greater than 0.33. The latest developments in terms of the OGC Standards for data encoding took place in the GeoPackage standard. For accessing, processing or visualising data, the trend was the development of OGC API related standards. However, GML is the most implemented OGC Standard for data encoding in OSGeo Projects, along with Web Services like WMS, WFS, WCS and WPS for accessing, processing and visualising the data. Community Standards represented less than 10% of the OGC Standards, while Community Projects represented more than 50% of the OSGeo Projects. The adoption of these technologies were evaluated based on the number of Github forks and stars, as well as Docker pulls. With more than 100 million pulls, PostGIS is the most downloaded OSGeo Project, followed by GeoNetwork and Open Data Cube, with more than 5 million pulls each. But many of the analysed technologies lacked an official Docker image. In terms of Github forks and stars, the most shared and favoured OSGeo project is OpenLayers, followed by QGIS and GDAL. The Latent Dirichlet Allocation analyses found eight topics underlying the OGC Standards and OSGeo Projects. The keywords of the top four topics were conformance, layer, tile and response. Based on the analysis of the Implementation Standard and Community Standard documentations, the most similar OGC Standards were OGC API - Tiles and Two Dimensional Tile Matrix Set. On the other hand, based on the analysis of developer manuals, the most similar OSGeo Projects were GDAL and MDAL. The strongest relationship of an OGC Standard and an OSGeo Project occurred between WPS and ZOO-project, followed by WPS and PyWPS. Overall, the OSGeo Project most closely related to the entire set of OGC Standards was rasdaman, followed by MapServer and deegree. Notably, a large group of standards and projects showed scarce connections, mainly those that are domain specific, like PubSub, LAS and PipelineML among the OGC Standards and like Giswater and MobilityDB among the OSGeo Community Projects, or those that are the basis of the other technologies, like Simple Features, WKT and Coordinate Transformation standards and like PROJ and PostGIS projects. The presented Systematic Technology Review can promote the evolution of the current OGC Standards and OSGeo Projects, as well as the development of new technologies. It can also support developers of new solutions in the geospatial community. Specifically, this review is the basis for the proposal of a new library for the integrated access of INPE’s environmental databases. An important limitation of this systematic review is that it was not possible to find any PDF documentation for almost 20% of the existing technologies, which were excluded from the analysis.</abstract>

                <title>SIMMAM 3.0 – Updating the Toolbox for the Conservation of Marine Mammals</title>

                <abstract>Marine mammals occur in low densities and usually in areas that are difficult to access. One of the main sources of information for marine mammals are stranded animals. However, strandings are rare events and to be biologically meaningful they need to be accumulated over large distances, long times, or both. This work describes SIMMAM (Sistema de Apoio ao Monitoramento de Mamíferos Marinhos), a project aimed at organizing a database of marine mammal sightings and strandings along the Brazilian coast and available at https://libgeo.univali.br/simmam. It began as an internal research project by UNIVALI but now is used by IBAMA and ICMBio. Its initial implementation has already been described [Moraes, 2005; Barreto et al., 2006]. However, it was almost completely rewritten since its initial implementation and SIMMAM 3.0 now conforms to the DarwinCore (DwC) standard, which is an international scientific initiative of the Taxonomic Database Working Group - TDWG. The data architecture adopted is compatible with GBIF, which allows SIMMAM to become a data publisher of marine mammal occurrences.
For the development of SIMMAM 3.0 free source code tools were adopted. On the server side, PHP 7.4 was used with Symfony 5.x framework. For the web client side, the site is rendered on the server side and delivered to the browser as an HTML + JavaScript page with Bootstrap 5. The data exchange API was also implemented in PHP, following the XML standard of DwC. Data is stored in PostgreSQL 11.x with PostGIS 3.x which allows manipulation of geospatialized data. Tables were structured according to the DwC standard, to reduce the complexity of the communication API.
As all occurrences in SIMMAM need to have a geographic position, the main interface for users to view the data is through an interactive WebGIS. The implemented WebGIS has filters by taxon and by type of occurrence (sighting, stranding, incidental capture) to allow users to focus on specific data. To better display areas with high density of records without generating visual clutter, the occurrence layer was clustered, grouping and ungrouping records according to the zoom level. Leaflet Map [Agafonkin, 2020] was used with the OpenStreetMap base map, as it is a modern map engine, has functionalities optimized for mobile devices, and does not have any external dependency. Leaflet supports multiple layers and is compatible with the Open Geospational Consortium (OGC) standard such as support for map mosaics, georeferenced images, WMS [Leaflet, 2020] and GeoJSON [IETF, 2021].
One key aspect of biological information is the taxonomic identification. To avoid taxonomic instability in SIMMAM, it uses the taxonomic list provided by the Integrated Taxonomic Information System – ITIS (www.itis.gov). As the taxonomic classification of mammals is very stable, it was decided to keep a copy of the ITIS database locally to reduce latency, being updated on demand. 
The types of occurrence records currently supported by SIMMAM are stranding, incidental capture and sightings. All these occurrence records have fields for defining the best taxonomic level, geo-referencing the occurrence, information on biological material collected and the person responsible for the data. Stranding and incidental capture records contain information regarding the state of the animal (alive or dead), the condition of the carcass (decomposition stage), sex and length. For sightings it is possible to inform environmental parameters such as weather condition, sea state, wind speed, as well as if it was a single animal, part of a group and group size.
The first version of SIMMAM was made available in 2007 to the Centro Mamíferos Aquáticos - CMA, that started to use it as the main tool to integrate data for the Brazilian Stranding Network of Aquatic Mammals (Rede de Encalhes de Mamíferos Aquáticos do Brasil, REMAB). On the same year, SIMMAM was presented to the then General Coordination of Oil and Gas (Coordenação Geral de Petróleo e Gás – CGPEG), current General Coordination of Marine and Coastal Enterprises (Coordenação-Geral de Licenciamento Ambiental de Empreendimentos Marinhos e Costeiros – CGMAC), that used it to aggregate and organize marine mammal sighting data generated by marine mammal observers [Barreto et al., 2019; Britto; 2009]. Presently, sighting data are regularly uploaded to SIMMAM directly by the licensed companies. 
As of June 2024, SIMMAM has 423 active users and holds 75,340 aquatic mammal records. Of these, 61% records are private, but this proportion is very different depending on the type of record. For strandings, that are in most part submitted by research institutions, 91% are private as they are the results of individual efforts. But for sightings 61% are public, as they come mostly from the oil industry as part of the environmental licensing of their operations, and they mirror the public reports that have been delivered to IBAMA. As mentioned before, all the data held in the SIMMAM database, regardless of its public availability, can be seen by Brazilian environmental agencies (IBAMA and ICMBio). 
The option to allow government agencies to use the whole dataset is extremely important for management purposes, as it enables environmental agencies to use even unpublished data generated by research institutions. But as the data is not available for the general public, it does not compromise their future use in academic publications. Also, a limited visualization of private data in the WebGIS, where details of the record such as species and date are not shown, serves as an indication for other researchers that a specific institution has data on marine mammals in a specific area, fostering collaborations among institutions.
We believe that presenting this work at FOSS4G 2024 will allow us to discuss SIMMAM with the geospatial community and receive input to further improve the system. It shows a successful implementation of open geospatial technologies that is being used both by government and the academic community.</abstract>
