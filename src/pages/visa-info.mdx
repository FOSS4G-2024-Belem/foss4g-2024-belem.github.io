**Countries that need to process a visa to enter Brazil**

However, there are countries whose citizens need to obtain a visa before traveling to Brazil. These visas can be for tourism, study, work or residence purposes where the citizen holds a common visa.

- **Access a consular office**: find the one closest to you at this link: [https://www.gov.br/mre/pt-br/assuntos/portal-consular](https://www.gov.br/mre/pt-br/assuntos/portal-consular)
- **Complete and submit the required documentation on this form**: [https://formulario-mre.serpro.gov.br/sci/pages/web/ui/#/cidadao-nacionalidade](https://formulario-mre.serpro.gov.br/sci/pages/web/ui/#/cidadao-nacionalidade)
- **Pay the fees**: Consular fees vary depending on the currency of the consular jurisdiction.
- **Check at least 6 months in advance**, as the time to obtain the visa will depend on the Consular Office.
