#### By sea

In addition to access by air, the city has an excellent structure for river transport. El Puerto de Belém connects with several other destinations in the north of Brazil, such as Manaos, Santarém and Macapá.

To enter Belém do Pará by sea, there are two main entry points:

- **Puerto de Belém**: Belém has an important commercial port, so arriving by sea directly to this port is a common option. Cargo boats and passengers can dock at the port of Belém, which is located in the center of the city.

- **Puerto de Val de Cans**: this is the port of Belém that receives passenger and tourist boats. It is located about 10 kilometers from the center of the city and is where cruisers and some passenger boats land.

Remember to bring the necessary documents to enter through customs: such as your valid passport, visa if necessary, boarding pass, among other documents.

#### By car

Belém do Pará has several ways of access by road from other parts of the country. However, since the city is located in the northern region of Brazil, main access from other countries by road usually involves entering from the borders with neighboring countries, especially from Suriname, Guyana and Venezuela.

Here are some main border routes you could consider to enter Belém do Pará by road from other countries:
- Frontera con Surinam (Oiapoque - Albina)
- Frontera con Guyana (Bonfim - Lethem) 
- Frontera con Venezuela (Pacaraima - Santa Elena de Uairén)
