      #### Academic Track Description
      ---

      Following an established tradition, FOSS4G organizes an Academic Track that will take place during the days of the Conference. The FOSS4G 2024 Scientific Committee invites original research contributions addressing any topic or domain related to open source geospatial software, including (but not limited to) open hardware, open software development, open GIS science, open geospatial data and systems, geospatial data exchange, open geospatial cloud platforms and services, open geospatial education, participatory cartography, digital twins, geoAI and geospatial machine learning.

      Articles of all types are welcome, including achieved results, case studies, work in progress, reviews, and demonstrations. We advise against, however, mere presentations of technology or use cases without adequately justifying originality against the scientific state of the art and without particular novelty. Furthermore, authors should properly highlight the use of open-source geospatial software. We especially look forward to contributions from doctoral students and researchers.

      When evaluating proposals, the <IntlLink href="/conference-committees">Scientific Committee</IntlLink> will pay special attention to the research's reproducibility (when applicable). Researchers ensure reproducibility by making all artifacts (input data, computational steps, methods, and code) openly available to achieve consistent results. And, when available, the code is made public under an open source license.

    **Step 1**:
    Authors are invited to submit abstracts written in English that are between 800 and 1000 words long and contain sufficient details for evaluation, including the concepts, methodology, and results, highlighting the reasons why they would be interesting for the FOSS4G Academic Track audience.

    The members of the Scientific Committee will evaluate the submitted abstract based on its originality/scientific novelty, relevance to the FOSS4G community, presentation/clarity, and overall quality. Reproducibility will be considered among the evaluation criteria.

    **Step 2**:
    Authors of accepted abstracts should provide an extended version of their work considering the comments and suggestions received in Step 1.

    We will not review the extended versions of the accepted abstracts again. However, we will check them against the formatting guidelines.

    #### Presentation
    ---

    The Academic Track program will only include talks or posters from authors who submit extended papers that adhere to the template. In other words, no presentation at the Academic Track is possible without submitting a paper.

    Authors should register for the conference in order to present their accepted work. We can accept up to two papers per registration. If you select this option and both abstracts (with only one author registered for the conference) receive acceptance, one will be indicated for oral presentation and the other as a poster, depending on our decision at a later stage. Alternatively, based on the reviews, you can choose to present both proposals through posters. Regardless of the situation (1 oral presentation, 1 poster or 2 posters), the authors must write two papers for Step 2.


    #### Proceedings
    ---
    The works accepted and presented in the Academic Track will be published in the complete Proceedings of FOSS4G 2024, before the first day of the conference.
