    Workshops are hands-on sessions where attendees can learn a specific FOSS4G software, package, or library for problem-solving.

    #### Submit a workshop
    ---

    When submitting a workshop, use the abstract to clarify the scope and content. It is in your and your attendees' best interest to ensure your objectives are well-defined. Include the list of topics you want to cover and links to data and tutorials that will be used to familiarize attendees with the topic.

    You will be asked to indicate the level 1-4 (from beginner to very advanced) required knowledge that attendees should have.

    The workshops will be held on December 2nd and 3rd.
