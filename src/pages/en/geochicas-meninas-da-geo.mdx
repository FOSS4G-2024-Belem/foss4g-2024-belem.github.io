[Geochicas](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geochicas) is a collective of feminist mappers within OpenStreetMap, OSGeo and technology communities. Geochicas works on the production of feminist geospatial data, as well as reducing the gender gap in the OpenStreetMap communities and in communities associated with the world of free software and open data.

  
Geochicas Take Belém is the 16th edition of this meeting. The event seeks to create a dynamic space for dialogue, coexistence and fun between women and different genders.
