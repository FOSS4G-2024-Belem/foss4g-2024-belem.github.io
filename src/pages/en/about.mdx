        #### FOSS4G Conference
        ---
        
        FOSS4G is the acronym for Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial. It is the annual recurring global event hosted by [OSGeo](https://www.osgeo.org/), the non-profit organization that supports and promotes the collaborative development of free and open source geographic technologies and open geospatial data.
        
        The conference covers all kinds of topics related to geospatial information and earth observation openness from Software development to Transition to FOSS4G, Use cases and applications, Education and research and Open data.

        This event is for all kinds of people interested in sharing experiences about maps, from developers who write code to users of geomatics software, people who make decisions, researchers, students and anyone who wants to learn, share and meet like GIS interested people.

        It attracts over 1,000 practitioners and advocates for free and open source software for geospatial and the tendency is to increase this number every year. It is the main meeting place and educational outreach opportunity for OSGeo members, supporters and newcomers - to share and learn from one another in presentations, hands-on workshops and a conference exhibition.

        For appreciating the quality and variety of the presentations, you can watch video recordings of past FOSS4G events on the [FOSS4G YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/FOSS4G/)

        #### Who hosts the event?
        ---

        FOSS4G is hosted by the Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo), in collaboration with the local community. OSGeo was founded to support and build the highest-quality open source geospatial software, and is the host of the annual FOSS4G global event.

        The foundation's goal is to encourage the use and collaborative development of community-led projects, data development and education. Many important open source geospatial projects live under the [OSGeo umbrella](https://www.osgeo.org/).

        #### FOSS4G in Latin America
        ---

        For the first time in history, the FOSS4G conference will be held presentially in Latin America, and we are extremely excited to host our international community of geospatial colleagues here in Belém, Brazil.

        The use of Free and Open Source Geospatial software has had a long history here, with organic communities popping up in many countries across the continent in order to support and promote its use.

        However, even with the wide usage of FOSS4G software in Latin America, historically the representation of Latin Americans has been quite low at FOSS4G conferences.
        
        By hosting the FOSS4G conference in South America, we are hoping to reverse that trend and serve as a meeting place for like-minded geospatial people across the continent and across the globe.

        #### Focus on Belém do Pará, Brazil.
        ---

        As Belém is one of the regional capitals of the Amazon, numerous NGOs and government organizations have their headquarters to carry out spatial data collection and analysis for sustainability purposes. These projects are related to the fight against deforestation or the empowerment of indigenous communities with geospatial software adapted to their needs.
        
        Our objective is to bring the indigenous agenda closer and make it present at this event. Another of our objectives as a conference is to generate a safe space to reduce the gender gap in the geospatial field, seeking the participation of women and dissidents.
