        #### The Conference
        ---

        FOSS4G is an international conference that brings together experts, developers and enthusiasts of open source geospatial technology.
        This annual event, organized by [OSGeo](https://www.osgeo.org/) and with more than 15 years of experience, is the largest global meeting of geospatial software.

        It serves as a platform to share knowledge, experiences and advances in the field of geographic information systems (GIS) based on free software.
        FOSS4G highlights the importance of collaboration, innovation and open access to geospatial tools, promoting an open and community-based approach to addressing geospatial challenges across diverse industries and communities.

        #### Our Vision
        ---

        In the exciting geospatial field, free and open source technologies are the key to driving innovation and democratizing access to powerful tools.
        By adopting open source solutions, you not only encourage transparency and collaboration, but you break down barriers, allowing a wide range of users to participate in the development and improvement of geospatial platforms.

        #### Focus on Belém do Pará, Brazil.
        ---

        As Belém is one of the regional capitals of the Amazon, numerous NGOs and government
        organizations have their headquarters to carry out spatial data collection and analysis
        for sustainability purposes. These projects are related to the fight against deforestation
        or the empowerment of indigenous communities with geospatial software adapted to
        their needs. Our objective is to bring the indigenous agenda closer and make it present
        at this event. Another of our objectives as a conference is to generate a safe space
        to reduce the gender gap in the geospatial field, seeking the participation of women
        and dissidents.
