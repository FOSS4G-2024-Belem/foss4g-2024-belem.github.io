### Hangar Infrastructure

##### Accessibility

It includes areas of accessibility to serve people with disabilities or reduced mobility. The place was designed to guarantee inclusion and accessibility for all participants. Some of the available access areas may include access ramps, elevators, adapted toilets and spaces reserved for wheel stalls and parking with capacity for 800 cars.

##### Family Conciliation

Please note that everyone is welcome to attend and we encourage friends or family who may have some interest in joining our community that also registers for the conference.

The security service is available on the FOSS4G with a limit of 30 children, only for 4 hours from 9 am to 12 pm or from 2 pm to 5 pm only available in the HANGAR facilities, only on mains sessions days.

For us to have a follow-up of those who need the service, for this reason we need you to sign up here:

**Registration form coming soon!**

Once we notify you that registration is open, you have time to register until **October 30, 2024**.

##### Languages

The resources of the team of volunteers and the organizing team, will have the language reference in which each person speaks.
We will have a track in the local language (Portuguese).

##### Violet room (safety point)

A safe place managed by event organizers will be provided, where they can come to the rescue if they feel that they are suffering some type of harassment or arrest related to sex or gender, as well as if they are victims of any other type of aggression. Any affected person can go to this place, both to notify a controversial situation and to clarify doubts, and if they are answered, it will provide assistance and the necessary access to contact specialized services in matters that correspond to emergencies and/or personal skills.
The processing and information will be treated with due data protection and anonymously in any case.

##### Exhibition Area

The Exhibition Area, where you can find our sponsors and partners, is at the Main Building.

##### Conference Badge

Each registered participant goes to the counter by name to collect the conference pass. Participants are asked to wear the badge in all conference spaces and during social events.

##### Conference Items

You can remove the products that we give you with the purchase of your ticket, on the display of the conference items. All participants will receive a bottle of water and a free handbag, and perhaps any surprises?
