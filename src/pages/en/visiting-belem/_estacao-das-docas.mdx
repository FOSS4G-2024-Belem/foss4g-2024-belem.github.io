  #### Estação das Docas
  ---

  The Estação das Docas (Dock Station) is one of the must-see attractions in Belém. The touristic complex occupies 500 meters of the river bank of the old port of Belém, built in the 19th century.

  Once a major commercial port, the docks were abandoned and left in disrepair until a thorough renovation restored them to their former glory. Today, the Estação das Docas complex is a popular destination for both locals and tourists, offering a variety of attractions, including restaurants, bars, shops, and cultural spaces. 

  Visitors can enjoy stunning views of the Guajará Bay, take a boat tour of the Amazon River, or explore the nearby historic center of Belém. The complex also hosts various events and festivals throughout the year, showcasing the region's rich cultural heritage and making it a must-visit destination in Belém.

  In addition, the Orla a Entardecer river ride, the best boat ride in Belém, departs from Estação das Docas from Tuesday to Sunday at 5:30 p.m. The route is very touristy but at the same time it is very interesting to take a trip through the rhythms of Pará and the north of Brazil.
