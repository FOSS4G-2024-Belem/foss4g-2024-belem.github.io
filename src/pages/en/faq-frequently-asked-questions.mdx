    <FaqBubble question="What languages are spoken in Belém?">
      The official language of Brasil is Brazilian Portuguese and it is spoken by 98% of Brasil's diverse population. Within Brasil there exists dozens of indigenous and regional languages, in various pockets throughout the country.

      While Brazilians do love international, English-speaking artists, English is not commonly spoken in the country outside of very places and only to a limited capacity.

      Spanish is also not commonly spoken in Brasil, although its similarity with Brazilian Portuguese allows for some degree of communication between Portuguese and Spanish speakers ("Portuñol").
    </FaqBubble>

    <FaqBubble question="What are the options for transport within Belém?">
      For a comfortable, familiar, and reasonably affordable transport option, we recommend rideshare apps such as Uber, Cabify, or 99, which all function in the city.

      There also exists the option of public transport, which is plentiful and very affordable. A bus fare can be expected to be anywhere between 2 and 8 Reais for transport within the city, depending on the distance covered and the particular service chosen. Transit directions are availble in various mobile apps, and more details about bus services can be found [at the official website](https://semob.belem.pa.gov.br/linhas/).

      Finally, in Belém exists an expansive network of bicycle paths, which is a great option to explore the city. Please refer to the [Bicycle Network Map](https://semob.belem.pa.gov.br/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mapa_Rede_Cicloviaria_Realistico-2019.pdf) for more details
    </FaqBubble>

    <FaqBubble question="Is tap water drinkable?">
      No, the water that reaches the Belém tap is not drinkable. It is
      recommended to consume mineral water or filtered water. Likewise, at
      the conference we will give out bottles of water.
    </FaqBubble>

    <FaqBubble question="What are the suggested restaurants and pubs in Belem?">
      Belém is a vibrant city full of culture, and there are many restaurants and bars to be found throughout the city, of many different types.
      
      The conference committee does not have a particular list to recommend, but you can browse the establishments <IntlLink href="/map">on the map</IntlLink>, or can refer to the [TripAdvisor Page](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurants-g303404-zfg11776-Belem_State_of_Para.html), for the best voted restaurants.
    </FaqBubble>

    <FaqBubble question="I'm worried about security. How should I behave?">
      Statistically, Belém is not a city with high levels of crime.
      Belém is the center of many activities for the region, such as the
      Belém Opera Festival, Carnival in Belém, Círio de Nazaré, Cinema
      Festival, among other things, without relevant conflicts. To avoid
      having a bad time you will have to take classic care when
      traveling to an unknown city where another language is spoken. It
      is recommended that you always have your belongings with you, and
      that you put away phones and cameras once they are used in public
      spaces.

    <FaqBubble question="What will the weather be like for the conference?">
      Belém has an equatorial climate, which means it is hot and rainy throughout the year. The average temperature range for December is 27-31°C (77-87°F), with a rainfall average of 116mm (4.6in).

      Safe to say, it will be hot and maybe rainy too; we recommend to plan accordingly. Stay hydrated at all times, and bring clothing appropriate for the weather.
    </FaqBubble>

    <FaqBubble question="What are the payment options at local hotels, shops, and restaurants?">
      Brazil's financial technology is quite advanced and widespread throughout the country, such that international credit cards are widely accepted, including at smaller establishments and even informal sellers on the street.

      The vast majority of tourism infrastructure, including lodging, restaurants, and tourist attractions, will accept credit cards, therefore having cash is not totally necessary. However, it may be worth carring some local currency, just in case. The currency of Brazil is the Brazilian Real (BRL).
    </FaqBubble>

    <FaqBubble question="How do I get access to Mobile Internet in Belém?">
      For Brazilian visitors, all of the major phone carriers have quality mobile internet services inside the city of Belém.

      For international visitors, we highly recommend activating international roaming on your phone plan, or if your phone has eSIM capabilities, purchasing a Brazilian eSIM. Most international airports in Brazil have free unlimited WiFi, so you can purchase and activate the eSIM on arrival.
      
      Purchasing a SIM card as a foreigner in Brasil is unfortunately a
      complicated process, due to needing a CPF number, which is difficult
      to obtain. To see a variety of eSIM options, check out [the Brazil page at eSIMDB](https://esimdb.com/brazil).
    </FaqBubble>

    <FaqBubble question="Which power plugs and adapters work in Brazil?">
      Brazil uses outlet types C and N at a voltage of 127/220V and a
      frequency of 60 Hz. These are the same plugs as many European
      countries.
    </FaqBubble>

    <FaqBubble question="What are the options for healthcare if something were to happen during my visit?">
      As with travelling anywhere, it is recommended to take out
      international health insurance before your trip to Belém. In
      addition, the Unified Health System (Sistema Único de Saúde, or
      SUS) allows free access to medical care.

      If you ever find yourself in a difficult financial situation, you
      will not have to worry, since the public health system offers you
      free check-ups and treatments.

      In case you wish to consult private medicine, here is a list of
      some expected costs:

      - Consultation with the family doctor: from R$120 to 500
      - Consultation with a specialist: R$280 to R$400
      - Consultation with the dentist: R$150
      - Simple surgical intervention: R$14,000 to R$28,000
      - Hospitalization (one day, not including treatment and tests):
        R$2,500 to R$9,000

      Of course, the exact costs depend on the state and city in which
      you receive treatment. But the price will be much higher in São
      Paulo, since the best doctors and centers are located there, and
      their services are in high demand. If you have an emergency, you
      should know the numbers to dial. If you need an ambulance, dial
      192 SAMU (Mobile Emergency Care Service).

      <b>Recommendation</b>: Drink plenty of water. Brazil is a tropical
      country, so we recommend that you stay hydrated at all times.
