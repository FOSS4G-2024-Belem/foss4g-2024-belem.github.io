    #### FOSS4G 2024 Call for Papers
    ---

    Welcome to the FOSS4G Belém 2024 Call for Presentations!

    If you have developed a free and open-source project related to geospatial technologies, implemented a FOSS4G solution or product, or are involved in a project utilizing FOSS, we invite you to participate in our gathering.

    You can submit three types of proposals to the call for papers:

    FOSS4G Global is OSGeo's flagship event and one of the most significant global geospatial events of the year. While the conference focuses on open-source software, it is a meeting point for sharing knowledge and experiences, learning new tools, and establishing new relationships.

    #### Speaker Suggestions
    ---

    The OSGeo community is characterized by its dynamic way of growing, and we are proud to welcome a variety of voices and ideas. If you are considering submitting a proposal to our call for papers, please consider the following:

    - The backbone of FOSS4G is free and open-source, so be sure to clearly indicate which open-source projects are essential in your talk.
    - If you are presenting new developments or a completely new open-source project, be sure to point out the corresponding repository(s) so people can follow your talk.
    - The more appropriate the selection of general and specific topics and the level of technical complexity, the better structured the final program will be. Please help us optimize your time at FOSS4G 2024.

    #### Expectations as a Speaker
    ---

    We believe in equality, so all presenters have exactly the same amount of time to present their work. Keep this in mind when preparing slides and consider the required time.

    Last but not least, the success of this event lies in the responsible actions of all participants and organizers. If after confirming your participation, you or the co-authors are unable to present, please inform us as soon as possible.
