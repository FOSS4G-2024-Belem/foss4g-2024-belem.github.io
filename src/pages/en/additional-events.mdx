[Geochicas](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geochicas) is a collective of feminist mappers within OpenStreetMap, OSGeo and technology communities. Geochicas works on the production of feminist geospatial data, as well as reducing the gender gap in the OpenStreetMap communities and in communities associated with the world of free software and open data.
