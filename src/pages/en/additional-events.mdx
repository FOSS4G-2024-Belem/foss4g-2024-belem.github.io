    The FOSS4G Community Code Sprint is an event where developers, contributors, and users of geospatial open-source software come together to collaborate on coding projects. The event provides an opportunity for the community to gather, share ideas, and work together on specific projects or features, driving the development of geospatial technology forward.

    During the code sprint, participants engage in intensive coding sessions, focusing on specific projects or tasks. The tasks which are worked on are determined by the participants themselves, with people both proposing code sprints and also offering themselves up to collaborate on other projects.

    Code sprints at past FOSS4G conferences have been a resounding success, serving as a valuable opportunity for conference attendees to follow and connect with people who share a similar interest.

    The Community Code Sprint is organized on an informal basis in the weeks and days leading up to the conference. Stay tuned to this page for more updates on the Code Sprint, which topics are to be worked on and how to join, in the weeks and months ahead.

    ---

    The QGIS LATAM 2024 Manifesto, themed "The South is Our North," celebrates the 2nd Latin American QGIS Users Conference as a hub for collaboration within the region's geospatial community. Inspired by Joaquín Torres-García's "Inverted America," the event challenges traditional perspectives and advocates for a geospatial vision centered on Latin American needs and realities.

    Held on December 7, 2024, at the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais - INPE, Belém ([OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/335405192) | [Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/F6FtNcFwGtrxGCLC9)), the conference aims to strengthen connections among professionals and champion free software, with a special focus on QGIS as a tool for empowerment and technological democratization. The QGIS LATAM community envisions a cartography free of hegemonic narratives, driven by and for the Global South.

    This gathering invites participants to build an inclusive, collaborative community that redefines the future of GIS in the region, fostering innovation, equity, and autonomy in Latin American geospatial development.
