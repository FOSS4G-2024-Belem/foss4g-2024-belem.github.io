    [Geochicas](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geochicas) is a collective of feminist mappers within OpenStreetMap, OSGeo and technology communities. Geochicas works on the production of feminist geospatial data, as well as reducing the gender gap in the OpenStreetMap communities and in communities associated with the world of free software and open data.


    Geochicas Take Belém is the 16th edition of this meeting. The event seeks to create a dynamic space for dialogue, coexistence and fun between women and different genders.

    The FOSS4G Community Code Sprint is an event where developers, contributors, and users of geospatial open-source software come together to collaborate on coding projects. The event provides an opportunity for the community to gather, share ideas, and work together on specific projects or features, driving the development of geospatial technology forward.

    During the code sprint, participants engage in intensive coding sessions, focusing on specific projects or tasks. The tasks which are worked on are determined by the participants themselves, with people both proposing code sprints and also offering themselves up to collaborate on other projects.

    Code sprints at past FOSS4G conferences have been a resounding success, serving as a valuable opportunity for conference attendees to follow and connect with people who share a similar interest.

    The Community Code Sprint is organized on an informal basis in the weeks and days leading up to the conference. Stay tuned to this page for more updates on the Code Sprint, which topics are to be worked on and how to join, in the weeks and months ahead.

    In the meantime, you can refer to the [past conference CodeSprint pages](https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/FOSS4G_2022/Community_sprint) to give you an idea of what to expect.

    The Code Sprint will be held **December 07-08, at the IFPA Campus Belém**, on the weekend after the main conference.
