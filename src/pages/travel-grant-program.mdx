</Head>

The TPG is an initiative designed to provide financial support to people who wish to attend the FOSS4G 2024 conference, but may face financial limitations in covering travel expenses.

Scholarship programs play a crucial role in promoting equal opportunity and access to education and professional development. By offering financial support to talented and motivated individuals who may face financial barriers, these programs expand the reach of the conference and its activities. In addition to fostering diversity, scholarships contribute to the creation of more inclusive communities by allowing diverse voices and perspectives to enrich academic and professional encounters. By investing in the potential of deserving individuals, regardless of their financial resources, scholarship programs lift up the entire community.

Like every year, OSGeo offers this scholarship program at the FOSS4G 2024 global conference, which will take place in Belém do Pará, Brazil, from December 2 to 8.
The TGP is provided by OSGeo and managed by members of the Belém LOC (LOC). Applications will be accepted until August 31, 2024.

The scholarship applies to countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.
