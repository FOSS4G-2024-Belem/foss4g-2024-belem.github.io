    bio: (
      <div>
        Luiz Motta has been involved with information technology from an early
        age, having completed a technical course in data processing in 1984 at
        the age of 17 in the city of Rio de Janeiro. In his adolescence, his
        passion was nature, with a strong connection to the beaches and
        mountains of his city. Due to this passion, he decided to pursue
        Forestry Engineering, and during his undergraduate studies at the
        Federal University of Viçosa in the state of Minas Gerais, he developed
        computer programs in his research projects. These projects later
        resulted in a master's thesis, one of the first theses in the field of
        Geographic Information Systems (GIS), titled "Use of a Geographic
        Information System in the Optimization of Forest Transportation" (1995).
        <br />
        <br />
        After leaving academia, he worked with GIS in a research center
        (Embrapa, 1996), public companies (IEF-MG, 2001), environmental
        consulting firms, and finally, in 2003, he fulfilled his lifelong dream
        by joining the career of Environmental Analyst at Brazilian Institute of
        the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (Ibama). In Ibama, his
        workplace was in the Amazon, where he could see how the occupation of
        the Amazon region was carried out. Later, he was transferred to the
        Ibama headquarters in Brasília (the capital of Brazil), where he
        dedicated himself to the development of Geoprocessing in the
        institution. His work had a global reach, as his GIS software plugins
        and scripts were shared on the Internet.
        <br />
        <br />
        His expertise in GIS development, especially in QGIS, where he was a
        contributor (with more than 10 plugins), provided experiences beyond
        Ibama, such as participating in the Planet Explorer program (2015) and
        the MapBiomas project (2019). In these projects, QGIS plugins were
        developed to access the data. His desire to help people in the
        Geoprocessing field has always marked his professional trajectory,
        serving as an instructor for various courses and providing assistance to
        other GIS users. Currently, Luiz Motta is with Prevfogo (National Center
        for Prevention and Combat of Forest Fires), being part of the Sisfogo
        (Fire Management System) development team. In addition to his
        environmental work, he is passionate about off-road adventures and is a
        member of the "Endurance Without Destination Motorcycle" Club.
